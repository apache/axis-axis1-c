Introduction
============

This guide will help you to start with Axis C++. I'll explain the minimum
steps needed to build and run Axis C++, and warn you about the common 
pitfalls.

What you need
=============
Expat or Xerces-c
Apache2 or Apache1

Note:
If you are using provided configure and Makefile.in's you don't
need to run autogen.sh script to generate them for your platform.
In any case if you need to run it then following versions are recommended
to be installed in your environment.
autoconf , automake , libtool ,  gcc


You can download the Axis C++ source or binary from one of the apache mirror sites 
    http://ws.apache.org/axis/cpp/download.html

You can get expat from the uri http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/

You can get xercesc from the uri http://www.xml.apache.org/xerces-c/download.cgi

Source distribution installation
================================

Unzip and untar the tgz ball.
You must define some environment variables in order to build.
AXISCPP_HOME is where you checkout Axis C++
------------------------------------------------------------
AXISCPP_HOME="/usr/local/axiscpp"
AXISCPP_DEPLOY="/usr/local/axiscpp_deploy"
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$AXISCPP_DEPLOY/lib:<path to parser library you use>"
export AXISCPP_HOME AXISCPP_DEPLOY LD_LIBRARY_PATH
------------------------------------------------------------
AXISCPP_HOME is where you extracted the source distribution.
AXISCPP_DEPLOY is where Axis C++ will be deployed

Axis C++ core is independant of the parser layer and transport layer.
You can write your own transport or parser library according to the APIs provided. Currently Axis C++
provides API implementations for Xerces-c and Expat. It also provides it's own client side transport
library implementation. In the server side deployment, Axis C++ provides two modules that can be loaded
into apache1.3 and apache 2 as shared libraries.
So this sums upto two posibilities.
You can deploy Axis C++ server 
    on Apache2 with xercesc parser or expat parser(Only one parser at a time)
    on Apache1.3 with xercesc parer or expat parser

When you build Axis C++ you can give options
1) Build for Apache2
   with Expat parser support only
   with Xerces paresr support only
   with both parser support
2) Build for Apache1.3
   with Expat parser support only
   with Xerces parser support only
   with both parser support

You can choose these selections when you configure

The build process

cd $AXISCPP_HOME

Following step is optional. If you need to generate configure and Makefile.in's instead
of the provided one's you need to run autogen.sh

sh autogen.sh

./configure --prefix=<Where you need to deploy axis c++> \
    --with-apache2=<path to apache2> \
    --with-expat=/usr/local/expat1957

For more configuration options use configure --help

make

make install

This will deploy Axis C++ into your folder of choice.

Following are some of the options availble with configure

--with-apache2 : To use apache2 as server transport library

--with-apache : To use apache as server transport library

--with-expat : To build expat parser library

--with-xercesc : To build xercesc parser library

--enable-samples : Whether you need to build samples(server and client)
                   By default samples are built. If you don't want building
                   the sample then you need to specifically say no

--enable-testcases : Wthether you need to build testcases
                     By default test cases are built. If you don't want building
                     the test cases then you need to specifically say no

--enable-log : Whether to enable log facility. By dafault this is enabled. If you don't need
               it say no to this

--enable-libwww : By default libwww client transport library  is built. If you don't need it
                  say no to this.

You may rename and edit build.sh_sample for one step configureing and building

Once you finished, have a look at $AXISCPP_HOME/build_errors. Most probably you will see many warnings.
Just ignore them. But if you see any errors it means that build was 
not successful and check whether you followed the instructions 
carefully.

You can see the folder $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/lib to see what are created

libaxiscpp_mod.so is apache module which is loaded when apache loads
libaxiscpp_mod2.so is apache2 module which is loaded when apache2 loads
libserver_engine.so is the Axis C++ server engine which is loaded by libaxis_mod(2).so module
libaxiscpp_client.so is Axis C++ client library
libaxis_transport.so is the Axis C++ client transport library
libaxis_expat.so is the expat parser library implementation for Axis C++
libaxis_xercesc.so is the xercesc parser library implmentation for Axis C++

Also $AXISCPP_HOME/sampels/server samples are built and installed in
$AXISCPP_DEPLOY/lib

$AXISCPP_HOME/samples/client samples are built and executable are in $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/bin

Add the following into $<apache install directory>/conf/httpd.conf

-------------------------------------------------
LoadModule axis_module modules/libaxiscpp_mod2.so (in apache1.3 replace modules with libexec and libaxiscpp_mod2.so with libaxiscpp_mod.so)

<Location /axis>

SetHandler axis

</Location> 
---------------------------------------------------

Now you need the deployment descripter(server.wsdd) to deploy server samples you built.
By default there is a deployment descripter in $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/conf to
deploy samples

In $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/etc/axiscpp.conf file you can give paths to
your log files, configuration files libraries etc.

Now we need to copy apache module(libaxiscpp_mod2.so for apache2 and libaxiscpp_mod.so for apache)
to the correct places and start apache. To
do that you can find scripts written in $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/bin.
cd $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/bin

To deploy on apache2
sh deploy_apache2.sh

To deploy on apache
sh deploy_apache.sh

When you run the above script,
libaxiscpp_mod2.so is copied to <your apache home>/modules folder.
libaxis_expat.so is renamed to libaxis_xmlparser.so. Also apache is started and libaxiscpp_mod2.so is loaded into apache.
libaxiscpp_mod2.so is the apache module for Axis C++. This will in tern load Axis C++ server engine
(libserver_engine.so).
Note that libaxis_xmlparser.so is loaded by the engine dynamically as parsing is required from the
engine.

Note that somewhere in the script above it change
the name libaxis_expat.so to libaxis_xmlparser.so.
If we use xerces we need to change
libaxis_xercesc.so to libaxis_xmlparser.so.

If you have done installation successfully it will display the Axis C++ welcome page when you point to URI http://localhost/axis .
Note: In the axis welcome page all the services in $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/conf/server.wsdd are listed. This does not mean
that the libraries corresponding to these services are deployed yet. It merely list whatever in the server.wsdd.

To run interop samples
cd $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/bin
./base localhost 80 etc.

(Check whether there is a script run_interoptests.sh in that folder which 
 can be used to run all the interop tests)

If you don't get it right check with the following list

* Check whether AXISCPP_HOME is set where you build axis c++ by
  echo $AXISCPP_HOME

* Check whether AXISCPP_DEPLOY and LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set where you start apache
  build axis c++ and run clients by
  echo $AXISCPP_DEPLOY
  echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

* Check whether you have necessary permissions to create the deploy folder which
  you give in configure option prefix.
  eg: configure --prefix=/usr/local/axiscpp_deploy you need permission to write in
  /usr/local/. Otherwise if you type make install you will get permission problems

* Check whether  paths in server.wsdd are pointing correctly to service or hanlder libraries

* Check whether axiscpp.conf is containing correct entries

* Check whether Axis C++  can write to log folder($AXISCPP_DEPLOY/log)


Binary distribution installation
================================

Unzip and untar the tgz ball.

You must define some environment variables first.
------------------------------------------------------------
AXISCPP_DEPLOY="/usr/local/axiscpp_deploy"
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$AXISCPP_DEPLOY/lib:<path to parser library you use>"
export AXISCPP_DEPLOY LD_LIBRARY_PATH
------------------------------------------------------------
AXISCPP_DEPLOY is where you extracted the binary distribution

Have a look at the folder $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/lib to see what is there

libaxiscpp_mod.so is apache module which is loaded when apache loads
libaxiscpp_mod2.so is apache2 module which is loaded when apache2 loads
libserver_engine.so is the Axis C++ server engine which is loaded by libaxis_mod(2).so module
libaxiscpp_client.so is Axis C++ client library
libaxis_transport.so is the Axis C++ client transport library
libaxis_expat.so is the expat parser library implementation for Axis C++
libaxis_xercesc.so is the xercesc parser library implmentation for Axis C++

Also server samples are in
$AXISCPP_DEPLOY/lib

Client samples are in $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/bin

Axis C++ core is independant of the parser layer and transport layer.
You can write your own transport or parser library according to the APIs provided. Currently Axis C++
provides API implementations for Xerces-c and Expat. It also provides it's own client side transport

You can deploy Axis C++ server 
    on Apache2 with xercesc parser or expat parser(Only one parser at a time)
    on Apache1.3 with xercesc parer or expat parser

This binary comes with libraries built for apache1.3 and apache2 support and 
parser libraries both for expat and xercesc

It also comes with all the sample libraries and sample executables and prebuilt tests.
But If you need to build the samples and tests for yourself from the sample and test source
do the following

Sample and Test build process

cd $AXISCPP_DEPLOY

Following step is optional. If you need to generate configure and Makefile.in's instead
of the provided one's you need to run autogen.sh

sh autogen.sh

./configure --prefix=$AXISCPP_DEPLOY

make

make install

This will put sample libraries into $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/lib and
sample executables into $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/bin

Add the following into $<apache install directory>/conf/httpd.conf
-------------------------------------------------
LoadModule axis_module modules/libaxiscpp_mod2.so (in apache1.3 replace modules with libexec and libaxiscpp_mod2.so with libaxiscpp_mod.so)

<Location /axis>

SetHandler axis

</Location> 
---------------------------------------------------

Now you need the deployment descripter(server.wsdd) to deploy server samples you built.
By default there is a deployment descripter in $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/conf to
deploy samples

In $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/etc/axiscpp.conf file you can give paths to

to the correct places and start apache. To
do that you can find scripts written in $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/bin.

To deploy on apache2
sh deploy_apache2.sh

To deploy on apache
sh deploy_apache.sh

libaxiscpp_mod2.so is copied to <your apache home>/modules folder.
libaxis_expat.so is renamed to libaxis_xmlparser.so. Also apache is started and libaxiscpp_mod2.so is loaded into apache.
libaxiscpp_mod2.so is the apache module for Axis C++. This will in term load Axis C++ server engine
(libserver_engine.so).
Note that libaxis_xmlparser.so is loaded by the engine dynamically as parsing is required from the
engine.

Note that somewhere in the script above it change
the name libaxis_expat.so to libaxis_xmlparser.so.
If we use xerces we need to change
libaxis_xercesc.so to libaxis_xmlparser.so.

If you don't get it right check with the following list


* Check whether AXISCPP_DEPLOY and LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set where you start apache
  build axis c++ and run clients by
  echo $AXISCPP_DEPLOY
  echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

* Check whether you have necessary permissions to create the deploy folder which
  you give in configure option prefix.
  eg: configure --prefix=/usr/local/axiscpp_deploy you need permission to write in
  /usr/local/. Otherwise if you type make install you will get permission problems
