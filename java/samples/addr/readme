The address book sample requires that you generate the Java bindings from
the AddressBook.wsdl file.

First, set up the CLASSPATH.  It must contain an XML parser (ie., xerces.jar);
all the jars in the lib directory:  axis.jar, commons-logging.jar,
log4j-core.jar, and wsdl4j.jar; and the directory containing the samples
subdirectory.

Now change directory to the directory that contains the samples subdirectory.

Finally, run the command:

java org.apache.axis.wsdl.WSDL2Java -s -d Session -Nurn:AddressFetcher2=samples.addr samples\addr\AddressBook.wsdl 

This will generate all the bindings, both client-side and server-side,
into the samples/addre subdirectory.

Now you can change directory to samples/addr and compile the sample.
BUT FIRST, this sample depends on junit, so you have to get junit.jar
(www.junit.org) and add it to your CLASSPATH.  THEN you can compile:

javac *.java

To run the sample, you will first need to run a server.  To run a very simple server you could run,
in a separate window:

java org.apache.axis.transport.http.SimpleAxisServer -p 8080

Finally, to run the client, simple run testit.sh or testit.cmd,
depending on your platform.
