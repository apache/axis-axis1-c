Deploy:
  java org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient deploy.xml

Usage:
  java samples.stock.GetQuoteClient <symbol>...


NOTE!!!
  Each symbol will be it's own Body element.  This samples demonstates
  that it's possible to have multiple children of the SOAPBody element,
  which can be used as an optimization - ie. do multiple RPC calls
  with one SOAPEnvelope.
