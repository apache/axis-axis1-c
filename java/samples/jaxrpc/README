The JAX-RPC compliance samples assume you have a service up and running,
either through Tomcat or some other web service, or via the SimpleAxisServer.
If you do not have a service running, you can start the SimpleAxisServer:

  java org.apache.axis.transport.http.SimpleAxisServer -p 8080

Set up the CLASSPATH.  It must contain an XML parser (ie., xerces.jar);
all the jars in the lib directory; and the directory containing the samples
subdirectory.

Since these tests are JAX-RPC-specific versions of other samples, they use
those other samples' deploy.wsdd files.  We will discuss the GetQuote1
sample, but the others follow a similar pattern;

cd to the directory containing the deploy.wsdd file:
  cd samples/stock/

Deploy the service:
  java org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient deploy.wsdd

Run the GetQuote1 sample:
  java samples.jaxrpc.GetQuote1 [options] <symbol>

  options:
    -d           turn on debugging - more 'd means more info
    -h<HOST>     server host name
    -l<URL>      ie. http://localhost:80/axis/servlet/AxisServlet
    -p<PORT#>    server port number
    -s<SERVLET>  ie. axis/servlet/AxisServlet
    -u<USERID>   user-id
    -w<PASSWD>   password

If you use the authorization and authentication handlers (which samples/stock/deploy.wsdd specifies) you'll need to add a couple of files to your Servlet Engine's current dir:

users.lst
 - list of users and passwords

perms.lst
 - list of users and allowable actions per user

Use the ones in the samples/stock directory.  Note also that if you are running the SimpleAxisServer, these files must be in the directory from which that program is run.

Here's an explicit example of running GetQuote1 using these files:
  java samples.jaxrpc.GetQuote1 -uuser1 -wpass1 XXX
