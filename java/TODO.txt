                           TO DO LIST FOR AXIS
                           -------------------

Please help to maintain this file, as accuracy is critical.  Major topic
areas are headed by section headings, and individual items are prefixed
with "!" (needs doing) "*" (in progress) or "X" (done), followed by the
owner (if any) in "<>" brackets.  Example:

                 * <Glen> Write TO DO list

MESSAGE PARSING / ENCODING
--------------------------
! <> Support literalxml encodingStyle

CLIENT API
----------

JAX-RPC COMPATIBILITY
---------------------

SOAP 1.2 SUPPORT
----------------
! <> Implement correct set of fault codes (4.4.5)
! <> Implement MustUnderstand-checks first (2.6)
! <> Implement NEXT and NONE actors (2.2)
! <> Implement new encoding model for arrays (Adjuncts 4.4.2)

PERFORMANCE
-----------

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
* <Glyn/Glen> Architecture doc
! <> Install doc. to mention placing Axis's javax... classes in Tomcat's classpath (e.g. in setclasspath.sh) as Tomcat won't load these classes from WEB-INF

SOAP SPEC COMPLIANCE
--------------------

SAMPLES
-------
! <> Clean up addr sample, including writing a how-to guide

WSDL2Java
---------
* <> (ongoing) JAX-RPC compliance.  In particular:
! <> Mapping of XML names.  We do some, not all, of what JAX-RPC specifies.
! <> Faults - What do we handle now?  What needs to be enhanced?  JAX-RPC needs improving, first, we think.
! <> Derived type support.
! <> Object[] doesn't work.  If we have method(Object[] array) and we pass in an Object[], we get NullPointerExceptions.  If, however, we pass in a String[] or a Phone[] then it works.  Object[] becomes xsd:anyType[].  Since anyType doesn't work, I don't expect anyType[] to work.
! <> do we want xsd:anyType to work?

* <Russell> (ongoing) Need to pull everything writer-specific out of the framework(Emitter/SymbolTable/etc).  Signatures are still in there.  So are Wsdl2java options that only the writers care about.

! <> Attachment support.

! <> Name clash resolution has to grow up.

! <> Automatically creating a package name from a namespace is very limited at the moment.

! <Tom> Literal soap:body support.  There is a large list of issues and things to do:
  - Need a test case, preferably one against a .NET web service.
  - The message type files are still emitted and they should not be.
  - We do not even try to emit faults differently if they have literal use
  - The operation parameter generation needs to be moved out of
    populatePortTypes in the symbol table and moved to JavaWriter (RJB - I
    don't know whether I agree with this, but it's a problem where it is).
  - If we discover a portType has multiple bindings, we abort.
    Since interfaces are generated from portTypes, and the literal/encoded
    switch is in the binding, we must have the binding todecide what the
    interface will look like.
  - We do not emit SOAPElement arguments per JAX-RPC yet.

! <Russell/Rich> If a reference to a type is encountered before the definition, a RefdType is created and added to the symbol table.  Once the type is defined, this RefdType is replaced by a real type.  Other objects may have referred to the RefdType.  Their references also need to be replaced.  This doesn't affect any of our existing tests.

* <Russell/Tom> Grow Filegen test.  We now generate code only if it's needed, but this feature isn't well tested yet.

! <> Do we need a Wsdl2java Exception?

* <Rich/Tom?> Need to handle collections of objects (max occurs > 1).  Rich did the work for encoding.  Does something still need to be done for literal?

Java2WSDL
---------
! <Russell?/Rich?> Java2WSDL "void op(boolean b1, Boolean b2)" maps to
   <wsdl:message name="op1Request">
      <wsdl:part name="in0" type="xsd:boolean"/>
      <wsdl:part name="in1" type="xsd:boolean"/>
   </wsdl:message>
  It SHOULD map to
   <wsdl:message name="op1Request">
      <wsdl:part name="in0" type="xsd:boolean"/>
      <wsdl:part name="in1" type="SOAP-ENC:boolean"/>
   </wsdl:message>
  Note that this also affects the runtime (particularly serialization).

! <> Support generating schema for custom serializers

! <> Support generation of deploy.wsdd from Java2WSDL

! <> Support wildcards in stop object classes (i.e. "javax.*")


METHOD DISPATCH / SERVICE METADATA
----------------------------------
! <Glen> Use QName lookup when processing doc/lit style stuff with
         RPCProvider


GENERAL / UNCATEGORIZED
-----------------------
! <> Reorganize resources.properties into packages
! <> Before each release, make sure there aren't any English-language 
     strings in the code.  Folks aren't very good about putting these
     strings into resources.properties!
! <Glen> Handle static methods without needing to create object instances
! <> Make Version accept org.apache.axis.utils.Options-style args


FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (not necessary for current release)
-------------------------------------------------------
! <> Some kind of support for deployment / metadata in source file (xdoclet?)
