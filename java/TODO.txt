Please help to maintain this file, as accuracy is critical.  Major topic
areas are headed by section headings, and individual items are prefixed
with "!" (needs doing) "*" (in progress) or "X" (done), followed by the
owner (if any) in "<>" brackets.  Example:

                 * <Glen> Write TO DO list

MESSAGE PARSING / ENCODING

CLIENT API

JAX-RPC COMPATIBILITY
---------------------
! <Doug?> Implement serializer/deserializer framework compliance

PERFORMANCE
-----------

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
* <Glen> Architecture doc

SOAP SPEC COMPLIANCE
--------------------
! <> Implement support for the actor attribute

SAMPLES
-------
! <> Clean up addr sample, including writing a how-to guide

Wsdl2java
---------
* <> (ongoing) JAX-RPC compliance.  In particular:
! <> The generated XXXService class should extend javax.xml.rpc.Service.
! <> Generate an error for notification and solicit-response type operations.
! <> Mapping of XML names.  We do some, not all, of what JAX-RPC specifies.
! <> Faults - What do we handle now?  What needs to be enhanced?  JAX-RPC needs improving, first, we think.
! <> Derived type support.
! <> Method overloading.

* <Russell> (ongoing) Need to pull everything writer-specific out of the framework(Emitter/SymbolTable/etc).  Signatures are still in there.  So are Wsdl2java options that only the writers care about.

! <> Attachment support.

! <> Name clash resolution has to grow up.

! <> Automatically creating a package name from a namespace is very limited at the moment.

! <Tom> Literal soap:body support.  (I'm not sure how far Tom's gotten on this.)

! <Russell/Rich> If a reference to a type is encountered before the definition, a RefdType is created and added to the symbol table.  Once the type is defined, this RefdType is replaced by a real type.  Other objects may have referred to the RefdType.  Their references also need to be replaced.  This doesn't affect any of our existing tests.

* <Russell/Tom> Grow Filegen test.  We now generate code only if it's needed, but this feature isn't well tested yet.

! <> --verbose could probably use some tidying up, particularly wrt types.

! <> Do we need a Wsdl2java Exception?
