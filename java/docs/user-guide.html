<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
Welcome to Axis! This is the <b>alpha 1</b> version, our first publically annouced 
milestone. Please note that this is a work in progress, and although the basic 
functionality is there, there are still a lot of unfinished areas and rough edges 
- so watch your step, and don't expect perfection. That said, we're very psyched 
about the package so far, and would love to get your take on how we can make it 
better. 
<h3>What is Axis?</h3>
<p>Axis is the third generation of Apache SOAP, which began at IBM as &quot;SOAP4J&quot; 
  and then became Apache SOAP version 2. The committers on the v2 project began 
  some conversations in late 2000 about making the engine much more flexible, 
  configurable, and able to handle both SOAP and the upcoming XML Protocol specification 
  from the W3C. After a little while, it became clear that a ground-up rearchitecture 
  was the way to go. Several of the v2 committers proposed very similar designs, 
  all based around configurable &quot;chains&quot; of message &quot;handlers&quot; 
  which would implement small bits of functionality in a very flexible and composable 
  manner. This system is the result of months of continued discussion and coding 
  effort in this direction. Some of the key Axis features include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Speed. Axis uses SAX (event-based) parsing to acheive significantly greater 
    speed than earlier versions of Apache SOAP.</li>
  <li>Flexibility. The Axis architecture gives the developer complete freedom 
    to insert extensions into the engine for custom header processing, system 
    management, or anything else you can imagine.</li>
  <li>Component-oriented deployment. You can easily define reusable networks of 
    Handlers to implement common patterns of processing for your applications, 
    or to distribute to partners.</li>
  <li>Transport framework. We have a clean and simple abstraction for designing 
    transports (i.e. senders and listeners for SOAP over various protocols such 
    as SMTP, FTP, message-oriented middleware, etc), and the core of the engine 
    is completely transport-independent.</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope you enjoy using Axis, and please note that this is an open-source effort 
  - if you feel the code could use some new features or fixes, please get involved 
  and lend a hand! The Axis developer community would welcome your participation.</p>

installing Axis. 
<h2><a name="Architecture"></a>Axis Architecture - a Brief Primer</h2>

<h2><a name="ConsumingServices"></a>Consuming Web Services with Axis</h2>
<h3>Basics - Getting Started</h3>
<p>Let's take a look at an example Web Service client, which will call the &quot;echoString&quot; 
  method on the public Axis server at Apache.</p>
<div class="example">
  <pre>1   import org.apache.axis.client.ServiceClient;
2   public class TestClient {
3     public static void main(String [] args) {
4       String endpoint = &quot;http://nagoya.apache.org:5049/axis/servlet/AxisServlet&quot;;
5 
6       ServiceClient client = new ServiceClient(endpoint);
7       String ret = (String)client.invoke(&quot;http://soapinterop.org/&quot;,
8                                          &quot;echoString&quot;,
9                                          new Object [] { &quot;Hello!&quot; });
10   
11      System.out.println(&quot;Sent 'Hello!', got '&quot; + ret + &quot;'&quot;);
12    }
13  }
</pre>
</div>
<p>(You'll find this file in axis/docs/examples/example1/TestClient.java)</p>
<p>If all goes well, this program can be run as follows, and should output:</p>
<pre>% javac TestClient.java
% java TestClient
Sent 'Hello!', got 'Hello!'
% </pre>
<p>So what's happening here? On line 4, we set up our endpoint URL - this is the 
  destination for our SOAP message. On line 6, we initialize a new ServiceClient 
  instance with our URL. The ServiceClient class is the center of the Axis client 
  API - we'll cover the very basics here, but take a look at the JavaDoc for this 
  class to see what it can do.</p>
<p>We're all set to go, so on line 7 we invoke the remote service. The invoke() 
  API takes several arguments - first, the XML namespace of the desired service. 
  Second, the method name which should be invoked. Finally, we pass an Object 
  array containing the arguments to the method.</p>
<p>You can see the effect these arguments have by looking at the SOAP which goes 
  out on the wire (look at the colored bits, and notice they match the values 
  in the call above):</p>
  <div class="xml">
  <pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;
                   xmlns:SOAP-ENV=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/&quot;
                   xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&gt;
  &lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
    &lt;ns1:<font color="#993333"><b>echoString</b></font> xmlns:ns1=&quot;<font color="#009933"><b>http://soapinterop.org/</b></font>&quot;&gt;
      &lt;arg0 xsi:type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;&gt;<b><font color="#CC00CC">Hello!</font></b>&lt;/arg0&gt;
    &lt;/ns1:echoString&gt;
  &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
&lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt;
</pre>
  <div align="center"> </div>
</div>
The String argument is automatically serialized into XML, and the server responds 
with an identical String, which we deserialize and print. 
<h3>Naming Parameters</h3>
<p>In the above example, the parameters are in the same order we sent them, but 
  since we only passed the objects themselves, Axis automatically named the arguments 
  in the SOAP messsage &quot;arg0&quot;, &quot;arg1&quot;, etc. If you want to 
  change this, it's easy! Instead of passing the actual Object value of your argument 
  in the arguments array, simply wrap the argument in an RPCParam class like so:</p>
<div class="example"><pre>  String ret = (String)client.invoke(&quot;http://soapinterop.org&quot;,
                                     &quot;echoString&quot;,
                                     new Object [] { new RPCParam(&quot;testParam&quot;, &quot;Hello!&quot;) };
</pre></div>
Now you'll get a message that looks like this:

<div class="xml">
  <pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;
                   xmlns:SOAP-ENV=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/&quot;
                   xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&gt;
  &lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
    &lt;ns1:echoString xmlns:ns1=&quot;http://soapinterop.org/&quot;&gt;
      &lt;<font color="#CC00CC">testParam</font> xsi:type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;&gt;Hello!&lt;/<font color="#CC00CC">testParam</font>&gt;
    &lt;/ns1:echoString&gt;
  &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
&lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt;</pre>
  
</div>
<p>You'll note the param is now named &quot;testParam&quot; as expected.</p>
<p>OK - so now you know the basics of accessing SOAP services as a client. But 
  how do you publish your own services?</p>
<h2><a name="PublishingServices"></a>Publishing Web Services with Axis</h2>
<p>Let's say we have a simple class like the following:</p>
<pre class="example">public class Calculator {
  public int add(int i1, int i2)
  {
    return i1 + i2; 
  }


  public int subtract(int i1, int i2)
  {
    return i1 - i2;
  }
} 
</pre>
<p>(you'll find this file in axis/docs/examples/example2/Calculator.java)</p>
<p>How do we go about making this class available via SOAP? There are a couple 
  of answers to that question, but we'll start with the easiest way Axis provides 
  to do this, which takes almost no effort at all!</p>
<h3>JWS (Java Web Service) Files - Instant Deployment</h3>
<p>OK, here's step 1 : copy the above .java file into your webapp directory, and 
  rename it &quot;Calculator.jws&quot;. So you might do something like this:</p>
<pre>% copy Calculator.java JRUN_ROOT/servers/default/axis/Calculator.jws</pre>
<p>Now for step 2... hm, wait a minute. You're done! You should now be able to 
  access the service at the following URL:</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost/axis/Calculator.jws">http://localhost/axis/Calculator.jws</a> 
</p>
<p>Axis will automatically locate the file, compile the class, and convert SOAP 
  calls correctly into Java invocations of your service class. Try it out - there's 
  a calculator client in docs/example2/Calc.java, which you can use like this:</p>
<pre>% javac CalcClient.java
% java CalcClient add 2 5
Got result : 7
% java CalcClient subtract 10 9
Got result : 1
% </pre>
<h3>Custom Deployment - deploy.xml files and the AdminClient</h3>
<p>JWS files are great quick ways to get your classes out there as Web Services, 
  but they're not always the best choice. For one thing, you need the source code 
  - there might be times when you want to expose a pre-existing class on your 
  system without source. Also, the amount of configuration you can do as to how 
  the service gets accessed is pretty limited - you can't specify custom type 
  mappings, or control which Handlers get invoked when people are using your service.</p>
<h4>Deploying via descriptors</h4>
One way blah blah blah. 
<pre>&lt;admin:deploy xmlns:admin=&quot;AdminService&quot;&gt;
 &lt;service name=&quot;MyService&quot; pivot=&quot;RPCDispatcher&quot;&gt;
  &lt;option name=&quot;classname&quot; value=&quot;MyService&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;option name=&quot;methods&quot; value=&quot;*&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/service&gt;
&lt;/admin:deploy&gt;</pre>
<p>Pretty simple, really - the outermost element tells the engine that this is 
  a deployment (other options are &quot;undeploy&quot; and &quot;list&quot; - 
  see the deployment reference). Then we deploy a service.</p>
<h4>Using the AdminClient</h4>
<p>Once we've got this file, we need to send it to an Axis server in order to 
  actually deploy the described service. We do this with the AdminClient, or the 
  &quot;org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient&quot; class. An invocation of the AdminClient 
  looks like this:</p>
<pre>% java org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient deploy.xml
&lt;??&gt;&lt;admin&gt;done processing&lt;/admin&gt;</pre>
<p>This </p>
<h4>More deployment - Handlers and Chains</h4>
<p>Now let's start to explore some of the more powerful features of the Axis engine. 
  Let's say you want to track how many times your service has been called. We've 
  included a sample handler in the samples/log directory to do just this. To use 
  a handler class like this, you first need to deploy the Handler itself, and 
  then use the name that you give it in deploying a service. Here's a sample deploy.xml 
  file: </p>
<pre>&lt;admin:deploy xmlns:admin=&quot;AdminService&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!-- define the logging handler configuration --&gt;
 &lt;handler name=&quot;track&quot; class=&quot;samples.log.LogHandler&quot;&gt;
  &lt;option name=&quot;filename&quot; value=&quot;MyService.log&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/handler&gt;

 &lt;!-- define the service, using the log handler we just defined --&gt;
 &lt;service name=&quot;MyService&quot; <b>request=&quot;track&quot;</b> pivot=&quot;RPCDispatcher&quot;&gt;
  &lt;option name=&quot;className&quot; value=&quot;samples.log.Service&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;option name=&quot;methodName&quot; value=&quot;*&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/service&gt;
&lt;/admin:deploy&gt;</pre>
<p>The first section defines a Handler called &quot;track&quot; which is implemented 
  by the class &quot;samples.log.LogHandler&quot;. We give this Handler an option 
  to let it know which file to write its messages into.</p>
<p>Then we define a service, &quot;MyService&quot;, which is an RPC server just 
  like we saw above in our first example. The difference is the &quot;request&quot; 
  attribute - this indicates a Handler (or set of Handlers) which should be invoked 
  when the service is invoked, before the pivot handler. By setting this to &quot;track&quot;, 
  we ensure that the message will be logged each time this service is invoked.<br>
</p>
<h4>Remote Administration</h4>
<p>Note that by default, the Axis server is configured to only accept administration 
  requests from the machine on which it resides - if you wish to enable remote 
  administration, you must set the &quot;enableRemoteAdmin&quot; property of the 
  AdminService to <b>true</b>. To do this, find the &quot;server-config.xml&quot; 
  file in your webapp's WEB-INF directory. In it, you'll see a deployment for 
  the AdminService. Add an option as follows:</p>
<pre>&lt;service name=&quot;AdminService&quot; pivot=&quot;RPCDispatcher&quot;&gt;
 &lt;option name=&quot;className&quot; value=&quot;org.apache.axis.util.Admin&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;option name=&quot;methodName&quot; value=&quot;*&quot;/&gt;
 <b>&lt;option name=&quot;enableRemoteAdmin&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;</b>
&lt;/service&gt;</pre>
<p><b>WARNING: enabling remote administration may give unauthorized parties access 
  to your machine. If you do this, please make sure to add security to your configuration!</b><br>

<h3>Encoding Your Beans - the BeanSerializer</h3>
<p>Axis includes the ability to serialize arbitrary Java classes which follow 
  the standard JavaBean pattern of get/set accessors. All you need to do is tell 
  Axis which Java classes map to which XML Schema types. Configuring a bean mapping 
  looks like this:</p>
<pre class="xml">&lt;beanMappings&gt;
 &lt;ns:local xmlns:ns=&quot;someNamespace&quot; classname=&quot;my.java.thingy&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/beanMappings&gt;</pre>
<p>Inside the &lt;beanMappings&gt; element is an arbitrary number of other elements, 
  each of which maps a Java class (presumably a bean) to an XML QName. The QName 
  of the element itself is the XML QName, and the value of the classname attribute 
  is the Java class name. So in this case, we'd be mapping the &quot;my.java.thingy&quot; 
  class to the XML QName [someNamespace]:[local].</p>
<p>Let's take a look at how this works in practice. Go look at the docs/examples/example4/BeanService.java 
  file. (we won't reproduce it here, it's pretty straightforward) The key thing 
  to notice is that the argument to the service method is an Order object. Since 
  Order is not a basic type which Axis understands by default, trying to run this 
  service without a type mapping will result in a fault (if you want to try this 
  for yourself, you can use the bad-deploy.xml file in the example4 directory). 
  But if we put a beanMapping into our deployment, all will be well. Here's how 
  to run this example (from the example4 directory):</p>
<pre class="example">% java org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient -llocal:// deploy.xml
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;&lt;Admin&gt;Done processing&lt;/Admin&gt;


% java Client -llocal:// -n &quot;Glen&quot;
Hi, Glen!


You seem to have ordered the following:


1 of item : mp3jukebox
4 of item : 1600mahBattery


If this had been a real order processing system, we'd probably have charged you about now.
%<br>
</pre>
<h3>When Beans Are Not Enough - Custom Serialization</h3>
<p>Just as JWS deployment is sometimes not flexible enough to meet all needs, 
  the default bean serialization model isn't robust enough to handle every case 
  either. At times there will be non-bean Java classes (especially in the case 
  of pre-existing assets) which you need to map to/from XML, and there also may 
  be some custom XML schema types which you want to map into Java in particular 
  ways. Axis gives you the ability to write custom serializers/deserializers, 
  and some tools to help make your life easier when you do so.</p>
<p><i><font color="#FF0000">TBD - this section will be expanded in a future version! 
  For now, take a look at the ArraySerializer, the BeanSerializer (both in org.apache.axis.encoding), 
  and the DataSer example (in samples/encoding) to see how custom serializers 
  work. </font></i></p>
