      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>This document describes how to install Apache Axis. It assumes
      you already know how to write and run Java code and not be scared
      of XML. You should also have an application server or servlet
      engine and be familiar with operating and deploying to it. If you
      need an application server, we recommend <a
      href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Jakarta Tomcat</a>. [If
      you are installing tomcat, get the latest 4.1.x version, and the
      full distribution, not the LE version for Java1.4, as that omits
      the Xerces XML parser]. Other servlet engines are supported,
      provided they implement version 2.2 or greater of the servlet API.
      Note also that Axis client and server requires Java1.3 or later.
      
      <p>For more details on using Axis, please see the 
      <a href="user-guide.html">user guide</a>.
        
     <h2>Things you have to Know </h2>
     
     A lot of problems with Axis are encountered by people who are new
     to Java, Server-side Java and SOAP. While you can learn about SOAP
     as you go along, writing Axis clients and serves is not the right
     time to be learning foundational Java concepts, such as what an
     array is, or foundation App server concepts such as how Servlets
     work, and the basics of the HTTP protocol. 
     <p>
     Things you need to know to begin to write a Web Service:
     <ol>
     
     <li> Core Java datatypes, classes and programming concepts.
     
     <li> What threads are, race conditions, thread safety and
     sychronization. 
     
     <li> What a classloader is, and what hierarchical classloaders are,
     or 'common causes of a ClassNotFoundException'.
     
     <li> How to diagnose trouble from exception traces, what a
     NullPointerException (NPE) and other common exceptions are, and how
     to fix them. 
     
     <li> What a web application is; what a servlet is, where classes,
     libraries and data go in a web application.
     
     <li> How to start your application server and deploy a web
     application on it.
     
     <li> What a network is, the core concepts of the IP protocol suite
     and the sockets API. Specifically, what is TCP/IP. 
     
     <li> What HTTP is. The core protocol and error codes, HTTP headers and
     perhaps the details of basic authentication.
     
     <li> What XML is. Not how to parse it or anything, just what
     constitutes well-formed and valid XML.
     
     </ol>
     
     Axis and SOAP depends on all these details. If you don't know them,
     Axis (or anyone else's Web Service middleware) is a dangerous place
     to learn. Sooner or later you will be forced to discover these
     details, and there are easier places to learn than Axis.  
     
     <p>
     
     If you are completely new to Java, we recommend you start off with
     things like the Java Tutorials on Sun's web sites, and perhaps a
     classic book like <a
     href="http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIJ/">Thinking in Java</a>,
     until you have enough of a foundation to be able to work with
     Axis. It is also useful to have written a simple web application,
     as this will give you some knowledge of how HTTP works, and how
     Java applications servers integrate with HTTP.
     
     <p>
     
     Be aware that there is a lot more to know to use Axis and SOAP
     effectively than the listing above. The other big area is "how to
     write internet scale distributed applications". Nobody knows how to
     do that properly yet, so that you have to learn by doing.  
     
     <h2>Step 0: Concepts</h2>
     
     Apache Axis is an Open Source SOAP server and client. SOAP is a
     mechanism for inter-application communication between systems
     written in arbitrary languages, across the Internet. SOAP usually
     exchanges messages over HTTP: the client POSTs a SOAP request, and
     receives either an HTTP error code or an HTTP success code and a
     SOAP response. 
     
     <p>
     
     SOAP messages are XML messages. These messages exchange structured
     information between SOAP systems. Messages consist of one or more
     SOAP elements inside an envelope, Headers and the SOAP Body.  
     SOAP has two syntaxes for describing the data in these elements,
     <i>Section 5</i>, which is a clear descendent of the XML RPC
     system, and <i>XML Schema</i>, which is the newer (and usually
     better) system. Axis handles the magic of converting Java objects
     to SOAP data when it sends it over the wire or receives results.
     SOAP Faults are sent by the server when something goes wrong; Again
     Axis converts these to Java exceptions. 
     
     <p>
     
     SOAP is intended to link disparate systems. It is not a mechanism
     to tightly bind Java programs written by the same team together. It
     can bind Java programs together, but not as tightly as RMI or
     Corba. If you try sending many Java objects that RMI would happily
     serialize, you will be disappointed at how badly Axis fails. This
     is by design: if Axis copied RMI and serialized Java objects to
     byte streams, you would be stuck to a particular version of Java
     everywhere.

     <p>     
     
     Axis implements the JAX-RPC API, one of the standard ways to program
     Java services. If you look at the specification and tutorials on
     Sun's web site, you will understand the API. If you code to the
     API, your programs will work with other implementations of the API,
     such as those by Sun and BEA. Axis also provides extension
     features, and many ways that extend the JAX-RPC API. You can use
     these to write better programs, ones that only work with Axis. But
     since Axis is free and you get the source, that should not matter. 
     
     <p>
     
     Axis is implemented in the JAR file <i>axis.jar</i>; implementing
     the JAX-RPC API declared in the JAR files <i>jaxrpc.jar</i> and
     <i>saaj.jar</i>. It needs various helper libraries, for logging,
     WSDL processing and introspection. All these files can be packaged
     into a web application, <i>axis.war</i>, that can be dropped into a
     servlet container. Axis ships with some sample SOAP services. You
     can add your own by adding new compiled classes to the Axis webapp
     registering them.
     
     <p>
     Before you can do that, you have to install it and get it working.
     
    <a name="webapp"/></a>
    <h2>Step 1: creating the webapps</h2>

    <p>In your servlet installation, you should find a directory into which web
    applications ("webapps") are to be placed. Into this directory copy the
    webapps/axis directory from the xml-axis distribution. You can actually name this
    directory anything you want, just be aware that the name you choose will
    form the basis for the URL by which clients will access your service.
    The rest of this document assumes that the default webapp name,
    "axis" has been used; rename these references if appropriate.

    <a name="depend"/></a>
    <h2>Step 2: setting up the libraries</h2>

    <p>In the axis directory, you will find a WEB-INF sub-directory. 
    This directory contains some basic configuration information, but
    can also be used to contain the dependencies and web services you wish to
    deploy.</p>
      <p>In the WEB-INF directory, you'll find a &quot;lib&quot; directory.&nbsp;
      </p>
    <ul>
        <li>In this directory, copy the jars associated with the JAXP 1.1 XML
          compliant parser of your choice. We recommend xerces jars
          from the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-j/">xml-xerces distribution</a>,
          though others work. If you omit this stage you may be able to
          use the default XML parser provided by the web application.
    </ul>

    <h3>Tomcat 4.x and Java1.4</h3>
      Java 1.4 changed the rules as to to how packages beginning in java.* and
      javax.* get loaded. Specifically, they only get loaded from
      <i>endorsed</i> directories. jaxrpc.jar and saaj.jar contain javax
      packages, so may not get picked up. If happyaxis.jsp 
      (see below) cannot find the relevant packages, place them in 
      CATALINA_HOME/common/lib and restart Tomcat. 
    
    <a name="start"/></a>
    <h2>Step 3: starting the web server</h2>

    <p>This varies on a product-by-product basis. In many cases it is as
    simple as double clicking on a startup icon or running a command from
    the command line.</p>

    <a name="install-test"/></a>
    <h2>Step 4: Validate the Installation</h2>

    <p>
    After installing the web application and dependencies, you should
    make sure that the server is running the web application.
    <h3> Look for the start page </h3>
      Navigate to the start page of the webapp, usually
      <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/axis/">http://127.0.0.1:8080/axis/</a>,
      though of course the port may differ.<br>
      You should now see an Apache-Axis start page. If you do not, then
      the webapp is not actually installed, or the appserver is not running. 

    <h3>Validate Axis with happyaxis</h3>
      Follow the link <i>
      Validate the local installation's configuration</i><br>
      This will bring you to <i>happyaxis.jsp</i> a test page that verifies that needed and
      optional libraries are present. The URL for this will be something
      like 
      <A
      href="http://localhost:8080/axis/happyaxis.jsp">
      http://localhost:8080/axis/happyaxis.jsp</A>
      <p>
      If any of the needed libraries are missing,
      Axis will not work. <br><b>You must not proceed until all needed libraries
      can be found, and this validation page is happy.</b> <br>
      Optional components are optional; install them as your need arises.
      If you see nothing but an internal server error and an exception
      trace, then you probably have multiple XML parsers on the
      classpath, and this is causing version confusion.

      <h3>Look for some services</h3>
      From the start page, select <i>View the list of deployed Web services</i>.
      This will list all registered Web Services, unless the servlet is configured
      not to do so. On this page, You should be able to click on <i>(wsdl)</i> for
      each deployed Web service to make sure that your web service is up and running.
      
      <h3>Test a SOAP Endpoint</h3>
      Now it's time to test a service. Although SOAP1.1 uses HTTP POST
      to submit an XML request to the <i>endpoint</i>, Axis also
      supports HTTP GET access, which is useful for testing. First let's
      retrieve the version of Axis from the version endpoint, calling the 
      getVersion method: 
      
      <a
      href="http://localhost:8080/axis/services/Version?method=getVersion">
      http://localhost:8080/axis/services/Version?method=getVersion
      </a>
      This should return something like
<pre class="xml">
  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&gt; 
  &lt;soapenv:Envelope 
      xmlns:soapenv=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/&quot; 
      xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; 
      xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&gt;
      &lt;soapenv:Body&gt;
      &lt;getVersionResponse 
          soapenv:encodingStyle=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/&quot;&gt;
          &lt;getVersionReturn 
              xsi:type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;&gt;
              Apache Axis version: 1.0 Built on Nov 04, 2002 (01:30:37 PST)
          &lt;/getVersionReturn&gt; 
      &lt;/getVersionResponse&gt;
      &lt;/soapenv:Body&gt;
  &lt;/soapenv:Envelope&gt;
</pre>  
  The Axis version and build date will of course be different. 

    <h3>Test a JWS Endpoint</h3>
    
    Now let's test a JWS web service. Axis' JWS Web Services are java files
    you save into the axis webapp <i>anywhere but the WEB-INF tree</i>,
    giving them the .jws extension. When some requests the .jws file by
    giving its URL, it is compiled and executed. The user guide covers
    JWS pages in detail.
    
    <p>
    
    To test the JWS service, we make a request against a built in
    example, EchoHeaders.jws (look for this in the axis/ directory).
    <p>
    Point your browser at 
    <a href="http://localhost:8080/axis/EchoHeaders.jws?method=list">
    http://localhost:8080/axis/EchoHeaders.jws?method=list
    </a>.<p>
    This should return an XML listing of your application headers,
    such as 
<pre class="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&gt; 
&lt;soapenv:Envelope 
    xmlns:soapenv=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/&quot; 
    xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; 
    xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&gt;
    &lt;soapenv:Body&gt;
        &lt;listResponse 
            soapenv:encodingStyle=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/&quot;&gt;
            &lt;listReturn xsi:type=&quot;soapenc:Array&quot; 
                soapenc:arrayType=&quot;xsd:string[6]&quot; 
                xmlns:soapenc=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/&quot;&gt;
                &lt;item&gt;accept:image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, */*&lt;/item&gt; 
                &lt;item&gt;accept-language:en-us&lt;/item&gt; 
                &lt;item&gt;accept-encoding:gzip, deflate&lt;/item&gt; 
                &lt;item&gt;user-agent:Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)&lt;/item&gt; 
                &lt;item&gt;host:localhost:8080&lt;/item&gt; 
                &lt;item&gt;connection:Keep-Alive&lt;/item&gt; 
            &lt;/listReturn&gt;
        &lt;/listResponse&gt;
    &lt;/soapenv:Body&gt;
&lt;/soapenv:Envelope&gt;

</pre>
Again, the exact return values will be different, and you may need to
change URLs to correct host, port and webapp specifics. 

    <a name="websvc"/></a>
    <h2>Step 5: installing new Web Services</h2>

    <p>So far you have got Axis installed and working, now it is time to add
        your own Web Service.
     <p>
     The process here boils down to (1) get the classes and libraries of this
     new service into the axis WAR directory tree, (2) tell the AxisEngine about 
     the new file. The latter is done by submitting an XML deployment descriptor
     to the service via the Admin web service, which is usually done with the 
     AdminClient program or the &lt;axis-admin&gt; Ant task
        
        
      <p>In the WEB-INF directory, look for (or create) a &quot;classes&quot;
        directory (i.e. axis/WEB-INF/classes ). In this directory, copy the
        compiled Java classes you wish to install, being careful to 
        preserve the directory structure of the Java packages.
        
      <p>If your classes services are already packaged into JAR files, 
      feel free to drop them into the WEB-INF/lib directory instead. Also
      add any third party libraries you depend on into the same directory.</p>

      <p>
      After adding new classes or libraries to the Axis webapp, you must
      restart the webapp. This can be done by restarting your
      application server, or by using a server-specific mechanism to
      restart a specific webapp.

      <p><span class="note">Note:</span> If your web service uses
        the simple authorization handlers provided with xml-axis (this is actually
        <u>not</u> recommended as these are merely illustrations of how to write
        a handler than intended for production use), then you will need to copy
        the corresponding perms.lst and users.lst files into the WEB-INF directory.</p>

    <a name="deploy"/></a>
    <h2>Step 6: deploying your own web services</h2>
    </table>

    <p>The various classes and JARs you have just set up implement your
    new Web Service. 
    What remains to be done is to tell Axis how to expose this web service.
    Axis takes a Web Service Deployment Descriptor, (a WSDD file), that
    describes in XML what the service is, what methods it exports and
    other aspects of the SOAP endpoint.
    <p>
    The users guide covers these WSDD files; here we are going to use one from
    the Axis samples; the stock quote service. 
    <ul>
        <li>Add axis.jar, commons-discovery.jar, commons-logging.jar, jaxrpc.jar, saaj.jar,
          log4j-1.2.8.jar (or whatever is appropriate for your chosen logging implementation),
          and the XML parser jar file or files (e.g., xerces.jar) to your classpath.
        <li>Look in axis/samples/stock for the file deploy.wsdd. This is the deployment 
        descriptor we want to tell Axis about. 
          
          
      <li>execute the following command from the samples/stock directory:
          <blockquote>
              <code class="java">java org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient <br>
                -lhttp://localhost:8080/axis/services/AdminService deploy.wsdd</code>
          </blockquote>
        </li>

    </ul>
    The <a href="user-guide.html">user's guide</a> covers the
    AdminClient in more detail, and there is also an 
    <a href="ant/axis-admin.html">Ant task</a> to automate its use in your
    build process.

    <p><span class="note">Note:</span>
    You may need to replace localhost with your host name, and 8080 with the
    port number used by your web server.If you have renamed the web application,
    something other than "axis" change the URL appropriately.</p>


    <a name="test"/></a>
    <h2>Step 7: testing</h2>

    <p>This step is optional, but highly recommended. For illustrative
    purposes, it is presumed that you have installed and deployed the stockquote
    demo.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add axis.jar, commons-discovery.jar, commons-logging.jar, jaxrpc.jar, saaj.jar,
          log4j-1.2.8.jar (or whatever is appropriate for your chosen logging implementation),
          and the XML parser jar file or files (e.g., xerces.jar), as well as the Axis
          installation directory to your classpath.
          Change directory to the distribution directory for xml-axis
          and execute the following command:
          <blockquote>
              <code  class="java">java samples.stock.GetQuote <br>
               -lhttp://localhost:8080/axis/servlet/AxisServlet -uuser1 -wpass1 XXX</code>
          </blockquote>
        </li>
      <li>You should get back "55.25" as a result.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><span class="note">Note:</span>
    Again, you may need to replace localhost with your host name, and 8080 with
    the port number used by your web server. If you have renamed the web application,
    something other than "axis" change the URL appropriately.</p>

    <h2>Advanced Installation: adding Axis to your own Webapp</h2>
    
    If you are experienced in webapp development, and especially if you
    want to add web services to an existing or complex webapp, you can
    take an alternate approach to running Axis. Instead of adding your
    classes to the axis webapp, you can add Axis to your application. 
    <p>
    The core concepts are
    <ol>
    <li>Add axis.jar, wsdl.jar, saaj.jar, jaxrpc.jar and the other
    dependent libraries to your WAR file.
    <li>Copy all the Axis Servlet declarations and mappings from 
    axis/WEB-INF/web.xml and add them to your own web.xml
    <li>Build and deploy your webapp. 
    <li>Run the Axis AdminClient against your own webapp, instead of
    Axis, by changing the URL you invoke it with.
    </ol>

    The process is also covered in chapter 15 of 
    <A href="http://manning.com/antbook">Java Development with Ant</A>,
    which can be downloaded as a 
    <A href="http://www.manning.com/hatcher/chap15.pdf">PDF file</A>.

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    
    Axis is simply an implementation of SOAP which can be added to your
    own webapp, and a webapp which can host your own web services.
    Installing it can be a bit fiddly, especially given Java1.4's
    stricter requirements. If you follow a methodical process, and test
    along the way, using happyaxis and the bundled test services, you
    will find it easier to get started with Axis.
