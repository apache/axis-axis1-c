      <p>This document describes how to install xml-axis in as unobtrusive of a
        manner as possible.&nbsp; There will be no editing of configuration files,
        setting of server classpaths, or the like.&nbsp; Instead, these instructions
        will rely only on the automatic configuration and isolation that every
        implementation compliant with the servlet 2.2 specification is required
        to support.</p>
      <p>For more details on using Axis, please see the <a href="user-guide.html">user's
        guide</a>.</p>

    <a name="webapp"/></a>
    <table width=100%>
      <tr><td class="section">Step 1: creating the webapps</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>In your servlet installation, you should find a directory into which web
    applications (webapps) are to be placed.&nbsp; Into this directory copy the
    webapps/axis directory
    from the xml-axis distribution.&nbsp; You can actually name this
    directory anything you want, just be aware that the name you choose will
    form the basis for the URL by which clients will access your service.</p>

    <a name="depend"/></a>
    <table width=100%>
      <tr><td class="section">Step 2: installing the dependencies</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>In the directory you just created, you will find a WEB-INF
    directory.&nbsp; This contains some basic configuration information, but
    can also be used to contain the dependencies and web services you wish to
    deploy.&nbsp; This is actually the recommended way to deploy as the servlet
    engine will then keep each web application isolated from each other.</p>
      <p>In the WEB-INF directory, you'll find a &quot;lib&quot; directory.&nbsp;
      </p>
    <ul>
        <li>In this directory, copy the jars associated with the JAXP 1.1 XML
          compliant parser of your choice. This generally means either the xerces.jar
          from the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-j/">xml-xerces distribution</a>,
          or the crimson.jar and jaxp.jar from the <a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/xml_jaxp.html">JAXP
          1.1 reference implementation</a>. </li>
    </ul>

    <p><span class="note">Note:</span>
    Note that there is no requirement that each webapp or the web server itself
    use the same xml parsers.</p>

    <a name="websvc"/></a>
    <table width=100%>
      <tr><td class="section">Step 3: installing the web services</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>If you got this far, the next step should be simple: </p>
      <p>In the WEB-INF directory, look for (or create) a &quot;classes&quot;
        directory.&nbsp; </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In this directory, copy the services you wish to
        install, being careful to preserve the directory structure.</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Again, isolation is preserved.&nbsp; And, by the way, should your services
        already be packaged into jar files, feel free to drop them into the lib
        directory instead!</p>

      <p><span class="note">Note:</span> If your web service will be making use
        of the simple authorization handlers provided with xml-axis (this is actually
        <u>not</u> recommended as these are merely illustrations of how to write
        a handler than intended for production use), then you will need to copy
        the corresponding perms.lst and users.lst files into the WEB-INF directory.</p>

    <a name="start"/></a>
    <table width=100% height="20">
      <tr><td class="section" height="16">Step 4: starting the web server</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>This varies on a product by product basis.&nbsp; In many cases it it as
    simple as double clicking on a startup icon or running a simple command from
    the command line.</p>

    <a name="install-test"/></a>
    <table width=100% height="20">
      <tr><td class="section" height="16">Step 5: Installation testing</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
    After installing the web application and dependencies, you should
    make sure that the server is running the web application.
    <ul>
      <li>Navigate to the start page of the webapp, usually
      <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/axis/">http://127.0.0.1:8080/axis/</a>,
      though of course the port may differ.<br>
      You should see an Apache-Axis start page.

      <li>Follow the link <i>
      Validate the local installation's configuration</i><br>
      This will bring you to a test page that verifies that needed and
      optional libraries are present. If any of the needed libraries are missing,
      Axis will not work. <b>You must not proceed until all needed libraries
      can be found, and this validation page is happy.</b> <br>
      Optional components are optional; install them as your need arises.

      <li>From the start page, select <i>View the list of deployed Web services</i>.
      This will list all registered Web Services, unless the servlet is configured
      not to do so. On this page, You should be able to click on <i>(wsdl)</i> for
	  each deployed Web service to make sure that your web service is up and running.
    </ul>

    <a name="deploy"/></a>
    <table width=100% height="20">
      <tr><td class="section" height="16">Step 6: deploying the web services</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>The various classes and jars you have just set up contain a number of
    interfaces.&nbsp; What remains to be done is to tell the soap and axis
    servlets how these are to be combined and what is to be exposed.&nbsp; There
    are a number of ways to do this, for now I'll simply describe one way that
    is suitable for automation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add axis.jar, commons-logging.jar, jaxrpc.jar, saaj.jar, log4j-1.2.4.jar, tt-bytecode.jar,
          and the XML parser jar file or files (e.g., xerces.jar) to your classpath.&nbsp;
          Locate the deployment descriptor for your service and execute the following
          command:
          <blockquote>
              <code>java org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient -lhttp://localhost:8080/axis/services/AdminService deploy.wsdd</code>
          </blockquote>
        </li>

    </ul>

    <p><span class="note">Note:</span>
    You may need to replace localhost with your host name, and 8080 with the
    port number used by your web server.</p>


    <a name="test"/></a>
    <table width=100% height="20">
      <tr><td class="section" height="16">Step 7: testing</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>This step is optional, but highly recommended.&nbsp; For illustrative
    purposes, it is presumed that you have installed and deployed the stockquote
    demo.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add axis.jar, commons-logging.jar, jaxrpc.jar, saaj.jar, log4j-1.2.4.jar, tt-bytecode.jar,
          and the parser jar or jars (e.g., xerces.jar), as well as the axis installation
          directory to your classpath.&nbsp; Change directory
          to the distribution directory for xml-axis and execute the following
          command:
          <blockquote>
              <code>java samples.stock.GetQuote -lhttp://localhost:8080/axis/servlet/AxisServlet -uuser1 -wpass1 XXX</code>
          </blockquote>
        </li>
      <li>You should get back "55.25" as a result.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><span class="note">Note:</span>
    Again, you may need to replace localhost with your host name, and 8080 with
    the port number used by your web server.</p>
