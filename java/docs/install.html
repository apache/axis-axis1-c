    <p>This document describes how to install xml-axis 
    in as unobtrusive of a manner as possible.&nbsp;
    There will be no editing of configuration files, setting of server
    classpaths, or the
    like.&nbsp; Instead, these instructions will rely only on the automatic
    configuration and isolation that every implementation compliant with the
    servlet 2.2 specification is required to support.</p>

    <a name="webapp"/>
    <table width=100%>
      <tr><td class="section">Step 1: creating the webapps</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>In your servlet installation, you should find a directory into which web
    applications (webapps) are to be placed.&nbsp; Into this directory copy the
    webapps/axis directory 
    from the xml-axis distribution.&nbsp; You can actually name this
    directory anything you want, just be aware that the name you choose will
    form the basis for the URL by which clients will access your service.</p>

    <a name="depend"/>
    <table width=100%>
      <tr><td class="section">Step 2: installing the dependencies</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>In the directory you just created, you will find a WEB-INF
    directory.&nbsp; This contains some basic configuration information, but
    can also be used to contain the dependencies and web services you wish to
    deploy.&nbsp; This is actually the recommended way to deploy as the servlet
    engine will then keep each web application isolated from each other.</p>
    <p>In the WEB-INF directory, create a &quot;lib&quot; directory.&nbsp; </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In this directory, copy the axis.jar from the xml-axis
        distribution as well the jars associated with the JAXP 1.1 XML
        compliant parser of yourc chioce.  This generally means either the
        xerces.jar from the xml-xerces distribution, or the crimson.jar and
        jaxp.jar from the JAXP 1.1 reference implementation.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><span class="note">Note:</span> 
    Note that there is no requirement that each webapp or the web server itself
    use the same xml parsers.</p>

    <a name="websvc"/>
    <table width=100%>
      <tr><td class="section">Step 3: installing the web services</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>If you got this far, the next step should be simple: </p>
    <p>In each WEB-INF directory, create a &quot;classes&quot; directory.&nbsp; </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In this directory, copy the services you wish to
        install, being careful to preserve the directory structure.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Again, isolation is preserved.&nbsp; And, by the way, should your
    services already be packaged into jar files, feel free to drop them into the
    lib directories instead!</p>
    
    <p><span class="note">Note:</span> 
    If your web service will be making use of the simple authorization handlers 
    provided with xml-axis (this is actually <u>not</u> recommended as these are
    merely illustrations of how to write a handler than intended for production
    use), then you will need to copy the corresponding perms.lst and users.lst
    files into the current working directory of your servlet engine.</p>

    <a name="start"/>
    <table width=100% height="20">
      <tr><td class="section" height="16">Step 4: starting the web server</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>This varies on a product by product basis.&nbsp; In many cases it it as
    simple as double clicking on a startup icon or running a simple command from
    the command line.</p>

    <a name="deploy"/>
    <table width=100% height="20">
      <tr><td class="section" height="16">Step 5: deploying the web services</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>The various classes and jars you have just set up contain a number of
    interfaces.&nbsp; What remains to be done is to tell the soap and axis
    servlets how these are to be combined and what is to be exposed.&nbsp; There
    are a number of ways to do this, for now I'll simply describe one way that
    is suitable for automation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Temporarily add axis.jar and the XML parser jar file or files (e.g.,
        xerces.jar) to your
        classpath.&nbsp; Locate the deployment descriptor
        for your service and execute the following command:
        <blockquote><code>java org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient -lhttp://localhost:8080/axis/servlet/AxisServlet
          deploy.xml</code></blockquote>
        </li>
        
    </ul>

    <p><span class="note">Note:</span> 
    You may need to replace localhost with your host name, and 8080 with the
    port number used by your web server.</p>

    <a name="test"/>
    <table width=100% height="20">
      <tr><td class="section" height="16">Step 6: testing</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>This step is optional, but highly recommended.&nbsp; For illustrative
    purposes, it is presumed that you have installed and deployed the stockquote
    demo.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Temporarily add axis.jar, and the parser jar or jars (e.g.,
        xerces.jar) as well as &quot;.&quot; (your
        current working directory) to your classpath.&nbsp; Change directory to
        the distribution directory for xml-axis and execute the following
        command:
        <blockquote><code>java samples.stock.GetQuote -lhttp://localhost:8080/axis/servlet/AxisServlet
          -uuser1 -wpass1 XXX</code></blockquote>
        </li>
      <li>You should get back "55.25" as a result.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><span class="note">Note:</span> 
    Again, you may need to replace localhost with your host name, and 8080 with
    the port number used by your web server.</p>
