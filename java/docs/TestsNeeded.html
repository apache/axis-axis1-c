<title>Axis Tests Which Need Writing!</title>

<h1>Testing, 1, 2, 3...</h1>

<p>Greetings, intrepid tester/developer/reader!</p>

<p>This file exists to keep track of various tests which someone needs to write for Axis
at some point.  Ideally, any time you write a piece of code in Axis, you should also write
<b>documentation</b> and <b>tests</b> for whatever functionality you work on.  Unfortunately,
we live in the real world and that doesn't always happen.  Hence, this file.</p>

<p>This is a place to keep track, in simple english descriptions, of particular tests which
need to be written.  It serves two main purposes : 1) to help us remember these things, and 2) to provide a starting point for development when people have some spare cycles or are interested in
finding some way to participate in the Axis community.</p>

<p>On to the (soon-to-be) tests:</p>
