NOTE: This document is a draft of a release plan for the first
dot release of Axis. Nothing in this document should be
considered authoritative until it has been discussed and approved
on the AXIS-DEV mailing list.



			  Axis 0.5 Release Plan 
			  =====================

Objective: 

    The objective of the proposed 0.5 release is to get a functional but
    not feature-complete version of Axis into official public distribution
    so that we may solicit feedback from the community and build
    momentum leading up to a 1.0 release by mid-summer.

Axis 0.5 Release:

	Code Freeze/Tag Date:	July 6, 2001
	Release Manager:	Glen Daniels

    The build must pass all unit tests and all existing test suites.

    Documentation must be sufficient to allow users comfortable with Java but
    with no prior exposure to Axis or SOAP to get started fairly easily.

    Javadocs for the public classes must be improved.


Issues That Won't Be Resolved In Axis 0.5
=========================================

(many of these will need to be complete by the next release, 0.8)

- SOAP w/Attachments
- Complete set of data types
- WSDL support
- SMTP transport
- Code cleanup

Release criteria
================

1. There should be no open bugs with the features which are supplied.

2. We must meet the 0.5 requirements set out in our requirements doc.
   (NOTE: Some of the 0.5 requirements on the doc, such as data type
   support equivalent to SOAP 2.2, probably want to be pushed back to
   0.8 in the interest of getting a release out.  Some of the above
   assumes we will do this)

3. ???

Configurations
 Axis must be tested standalone and in several J2EE containers to ensure
 compatability.  At minimum, Tomcat, JRun, and WebSphere must all work.

Maintenance Plan
=================

The release team must consist of at least 3 people.

The release team will coordinate the maintenance and support of Axis, 
dispatching bugs and user requests to developers and acting as the 
last resort in resolving major support issues.

"Support" caveat : as 0.5 is a "kick the tires" release and not a
production-ready one, we explicitly offer NO claims or guarantees
to provide any particular level of support for the package.  That
said, we will make an effort to incorporate user feedback into
the development cycle for the next release (after all, that's the
whole point!).

Release Team
============

The release team will be composed of the committers that give the binding
+1 on the release plan and release proposal. It must have at least 3
members, and follow the rules that will be established. 

The release team will coordinate the execution of the release plan, dispatch
bugs to volunteers, review commits, and act as a lead in the release
process.

One of the team members will act as "Release Manager" and will be 
responsible for building the milestones, making the announcements about
the release progress and all other roles that will be set by PMC and 
committers.
