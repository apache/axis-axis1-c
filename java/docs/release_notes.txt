Axis Alpha Release Notes

This is the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis/releases.html"> 
alpha release</a> of the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis">
Axis SOAP library</a>.  (Wondering what Axis is?  Please see our
<a href="xml.apache.org/axis/faq.html">FAQ</a>.)

This is an alpha release, and hence is not feature complete.  The main
missing features include:

- No support for SOAP attachments
- Deployment syntax not finalized
- Incomplete Apache SOAP 2.2 deployment descriptor support
- Minimal testing in EJB / application server frameworks
- No support for WSDL, XML-RPC, SMTP
- Limited documentation

The Axis team is working on all of these missing features.

So, why an alpha release?

The Axis code already has:

- [TO BE VERIFIED OR REMOVED BEFORE RELEASE:]
  Significantly higher performance than Apache SOAP 2.2
- Good interoperability with other SOAP implementations
- A streaming-oriented model for message parsing (SAX, not DOM)
- A modular, configurable message handling architecture
- A pluggable transport framewor
- An extensive package and functional test suite

Early adopters and advanced SOAP developers will find this release to be of
interest.  Most Apache SOAP users, and those who need a fully featured
next-version replacement for Apache SOAP 2.2, should hold off at least
until Axis's beta release.  Progress towards that beta release may be
viewed on Axis's <a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis/requirements.html">
requirements and status page</a>.
