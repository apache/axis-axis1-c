<h2>Axis Change Log</h2>

<h3>Changes from 1.0 to 1.1</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Axis supports JMS for reliable messaging between client and server. Note 
    that the actual wire format of JMS messages is vendor-specific at present, 
    so you may not be able to use this to connect arbitrary JMS clients and servers 
    without special bridging software. Refer to your particular JMS vendor for 
    details. (rule-of-thumb is &quot;if you can get a JMS connection working, 
    we can talk SOAP over it.&quot; :))
  <li>Many more WSDL and interop issues reported (thank you!) and fixed. 
  <li>Axis ant tasks are now documented, and are much enhanced. 
  <li>Axis now includes a Castor serializer, handing off XML marshalling to <a href="http://castor.exolab.org/">Castor</a>. 
    Castor integration offers schema validation and autogenerated Java classes 
    from a Schema. Pending documentation and tests, this code is left for the 
    experienced Castor user, who should look at the classes in org.apache.axis.encoding.ser.castor 
    to discover what is available. 
  <li>Fixed a bug where clients running Java1.4 needed servlet.jar on their classpath 
  <li>Fixed <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13682"> 
    a bug</a> with Axis shutdown on Tomcat 3.3.1
</ul>
<h3>Changes from 1.0beta-3 to 1.0</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Axis now passes the JAX-RPC and SAAJ TCK test suites.
 <li>Many bugs have been fixed.
 <li>Axis now supports (almost) all XML Schema types in WSDL
 <li>Some basic performance tuning has been done
 <li>Attachments are now supported in WSDL2Java
</ul>
<h3>Changes from 1.0beta-2 to 1.0beta-3</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Support for the new version of the DIME spec
</ul>
<h3>Changes from 1.0alpha-3</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Closer to JAX-RPC compliance.</li>

    with Attachments</a>.</li>
  <li>Much better XML schema type support.</li>
