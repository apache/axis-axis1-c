<h2>Axis Change Log</h2>

<h3>Changes from 1.0 to 1.1</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Axis supports JMS for reliable messaging between client and server. Note 
    that the actual wire format of JMS messages is vendor-specific at present, 
    so you may not be able to use this to connect arbitrary JMS clients and servers 
    without special bridging software. Refer to your particular JMS vendor for 
    details. (rule-of-thumb is &quot;if you can get a JMS connection working, 
    we can talk SOAP over it.&quot; :))
    
  <li>We include a more recent version of wsdl4j.jar (28/feb/2003).
  
  <li>Many more WSDL and interop issues reported (thank you!) and fixed.
  
  <li>One late breaking interop fix was a workaround for a bug in
  .NET1.0, which does not like empty arrays very much. This fix is not
  enabled by default. If you have trouble with .NET1.0 clients handling
  arrays, look up <b>axis.sendMinimizedElements</b> in 
  the global configuaration section of the reference manual. 
  
  <li>Axis Ant tasks are now documented, and are much enhanced.
  
<!-- you only get this if you build axis yourself, so  
  <li>Axis now includes a Castor serializer, handing off XML marshalling to <a href="http://castor.exolab.org/">Castor</a>. 
    Castor integration offers schema validation and autogenerated Java classes 
    from a Schema. Pending documentation and tests, this code is left for the 
    experienced Castor user, who should look at the classes in org.apache.axis.encoding.ser.castor 
    to discover what is available.
    --> 
  <li>Fixed a bug where clients running Java1.4 needed servlet.jar on their classpath 
  <li>Fixed <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13682"> 
    a bug</a> with Axis shutdown on Tomcat 3.3.1
  <li>Various documentation tweaks: improved installation guide, more reference documentation
      and a new security guide for anyone using Axis in production.
  <li>On the subject of security, three security issues were fixed; two related to XML
      entity/file inclusion on inbound messages and one potentially enabling cross-site-scripting.
  <li>Tcpmon lets you specify delays in message handling: sleep times in milliseconds
    every so-many bytes sent or received. This is useful if you want to see what happens
    to your client application over a slow link. Usually it becomes clear that your client
    application grinds to a halt unless all the calls are in a separate thread from
    any GUI.
  <li>Attachments are extended with direct access to the filename, and the
  ability to detach the file from the <tt>AttachmentPart</tt> so it wont
  get deleted on cleanup. Yes, attachments should now get automatically cleaned
  up when their owning <tt>AttachmentPart</tt> is finalized. Look at the
  javadocs for the specifics. 

</ul>
<h4>Improvements in Exception Handling</h4>

    The JAX-RPC specification of exceptions is now implemented; you may well be able
    to send abitrary exceptions over the wire and have them retranslated into Java
    Exceptions at the far end. Of course, non-Java destinations have a little problem there,
    all they get are the XML details to make sense of somehow. There is a lot to
    be said for creating, filling and throwing an <tt>AxisFault</tt> directly, and documenting
    the <tt>faultdetails</tt> elements for callers of all languages to make sense of. Axis now
    makes it easier to work with these details; consult at the <tt>AxisFault</tt> javadocs to
    see the new fault detail methods.
<p>

     Axis no longer reports AxisFaults at INFO level on the client or server,
     unless you configure the logging parameters to do so;
     see the reference documents for details on how to do this. There is one
     exception: we do log server-side any AxisFaults created from RunTimeExceptions
     that are thrown by web service methods you implement. This is because those
     are usually bugs (like null pointer exceptions) that service developers like
     to know about before
<p>

     For security reasons we have stopped sending stack traces over the wire to
     callers by default. The reference manual shows how to enable this on
     development systems.
<p>
     Finally, we know we still have more to do to get exceptions fully under control.
     For example, global <tt>OnFault</tt> handlers are apparently not called consistently,
     and we need to do a lot more interop testing across platforms and languages. We
     also need a willing volunter to provide a guide to exceptions in
     SOAP and Axis.
