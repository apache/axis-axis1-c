/**
 * <P>A factory for creating <CODE>SOAPMessage</CODE> objects.</P>
 *
 *   <P>A JAXM client performs the following steps to create a
 *   message.</P>
 *
 *   <UL>
 *     <LI>
 *       Creates a <CODE>MessageFactory</CODE> object from a <CODE>
 *       ProviderConnection</CODE> object (<CODE>con</CODE> in the
 *       following line of code). The <CODE>String</CODE> passed to
 *       the <CODE>createMessageFactory</CODE> method is the name of
 *       of a messaging profile, which must be the URL for the
 *       schema.
 * <PRE>
 *      MessageFactory mf = con.createMessageFactory(schemaURL);
 * </PRE>
 *     </LI>
 *
 *     <LI>
 *       Calls the method <CODE>createMessage</CODE> on the <CODE>
 *       MessageFactory</CODE> object. All messages produced by this
 *       <CODE>MessageFactory</CODE> object will have the header
 *       information appropriate for the messaging profile that was
 *       specified when the <CODE>MessageFactory</CODE> object was
 *       created.
 * <PRE>
 *      SOAPMessage m = mf.createMessage();
 * </PRE>
 *     </LI>
 *   </UL>
 *   It is also possible to create a <CODE>MessageFactory</CODE>
 *   object using the method <CODE>newInstance</CODE>, as shown in
 *   the following line of code.
 * <PRE>
 *      MessageFactory mf = MessageFactory.newInstance();
 * </PRE>
 *   A standalone client (a client that is not running in a
 *   container) can use the <CODE>newInstance</CODE> method to
 *   create a <CODE>MessageFactory</CODE> object.
 *
 *   <P>All <CODE>MessageFactory</CODE> objects, regardless of how
 *   they are created, will produce <CODE>SOAPMessage</CODE> objects
 *   that have the following elements by default:</P>
 *
 *   <UL>
 *     <LI>A <CODE>SOAPPart</CODE> object</LI>
 *
 *     <LI>A <CODE>SOAPEnvelope</CODE> object</LI>
 *
 *     <LI>A <CODE>SOAPBody</CODE> object</LI>
 *
 *     <LI>A <CODE>SOAPHeader</CODE> object</LI>
 *   </UL>
 *   If a <CODE>MessageFactory</CODE> object was created using a
 *   <CODE>ProviderConnection</CODE> object, which means that it was
 *   initialized with a specified profile, it will produce messages
 *   that also come prepopulated with additional entries in the
 *   <CODE>SOAPHeader</CODE> object and the <CODE>SOAPBody</CODE>
 *   object. The content of a new <CODE>SOAPMessage</CODE> object
 *   depends on which of the two <CODE>MessageFactory</CODE> methods
 *   is used to create it.
 *
 *   <UL>
 *     <LI><CODE>createMessage()</CODE> -- message has no
 *     content<BR>
 *      This is the method clients would normally use to create a
 *     request message.</LI>
 *
 *     <LI><CODE>createMessage(MimeHeaders,
 *     java.io.InputStream)</CODE> -- message has content from the
 *     <CODE>InputStream</CODE> object and headers from the <CODE>
 *     MimeHeaders</CODE> object<BR>
 *      This method can be used internally by a service
 *     implementation to create a message that is a response to a
 *     request.</LI>
 *   </UL>
