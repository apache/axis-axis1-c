/**
 * The container for the SOAPHeader and SOAPBody portions of a
 *   <CODE>SOAPPart</CODE> object. By default, a <CODE>
 *   SOAPMessage</CODE> object is created with a <CODE>
 *   SOAPPart</CODE> object that has a <CODE>SOAPEnvelope</CODE>
 *   object. The <CODE>SOAPEnvelope</CODE> object by default has an
 *   empty <CODE>SOAPBody</CODE> object and an empty <CODE>
 *   SOAPHeader</CODE> object. The <CODE>SOAPBody</CODE> object is
 *   required, and the <CODE>SOAPHeader</CODE> object, though
 *   optional, is used in the majority of cases. If the <CODE>
 *   SOAPHeader</CODE> object is not needed, it can be deleted,
 *   which is shown later.</P>
 *
 *   <P>A client can access the <CODE>SOAPHeader</CODE> and <CODE>
 *   SOAPBody</CODE> objects by calling the methods <CODE>
 *   SOAPEnvelope.getHeader</CODE> and <CODE>
 *   SOAPEnvelope.getBody</CODE>. The following lines of code use
 *   these two methods after starting with the <CODE>
 *   SOAPMessage</CODE> object <I>message</I> to get the <CODE>
 *   SOAPPart</CODE> object <I>sp</I>, which is then used to get the
 *   <CODE>SOAPEnvelope</CODE> object <I>se</I>.</P>
 * <PRE>
 *    SOAPPart sp = message.getSOAPPart();
 *    SOAPEnvelope se = sp.getEnvelope();
 *    SOAPHeader sh = se.getHeader();
 *    SOAPBody sb = se.getBody();
 * </PRE>
 *
 *   <P>It is possible to change the body or header of a <CODE>
 *   SOAPEnvelope</CODE> object by retrieving the current one,
 *   deleting it, and then adding a new body or header. The <CODE>
 *   javax.xml.soap.Node</CODE> method <CODE>detachNode</CODE>
 *   detaches the XML element (node) on which it is called. For
 *   example, the following line of code deletes the <CODE>
 *   SOAPBody</CODE> object that is retrieved by the method <CODE>
 *   getBody</CODE>.</P>
 * <PRE>
 *     se.getBody().detachNode();
 * </PRE>
 *   To create a <CODE>SOAPHeader</CODE> object to replace the one
 *   that was removed, a client uses the method <CODE>
 *   SOAPEnvelope.addHeader</CODE>, which creates a new header and
 *   adds it to the <CODE>SOAPEnvelope</CODE> object. Similarly, the
 *   method <CODE>addBody</CODE> creates a new <CODE>SOAPBody</CODE>
 *   object and adds it to the <CODE>SOAPEnvelope</CODE> object. The
 *   following code fragment retrieves the current header, removes
 *   it, and adds a new one. Then it retrieves the current body,
 *   removes it, and adds a new one.
 * <PRE>
 *    SOAPPart sp = message.getSOAPPart();
 *    SOAPEnvelope se = sp.getEnvelope();
 *    se.getHeader().detachNode();
 *    SOAPHeader sh = se.addHeader();
 *    se.getBody().detachNode();
 *    SOAPBody sb = se.addBody();
 * </PRE>
 *   It is an error to add a <CODE>SOAPBody</CODE> or <CODE>
 *   SOAPHeader</CODE> object if one already exists.
 *
 *   <P>The <CODE>SOAPEnvelope</CODE> interface provides three
 *   methods for creating <CODE>Name</CODE> objects. One method
 *   creates <CODE>Name</CODE> objects with a local name, a
 *   namespace prefix, and a namesapce URI. The second method
 *   creates <CODE>Name</CODE> objects with a local name and a
 *   namespace prefix, and the third creates <CODE>Name</CODE>
 *   objects with just a local name. The following line of code, in
 *   which <I>se</I> is a <CODE>SOAPEnvelope</CODE> object, creates
 *   a new <CODE>Name</CODE> object with all three.</P>
 * <PRE>
 *    Name name = se.createName("GetLastTradePrice", "WOMBAT",
 *                               "http://www.wombat.org/trader");
 * </PRE>
