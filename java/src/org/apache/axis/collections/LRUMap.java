/**
 * <p>
 * An implementation of a Map which has a maximum size and uses a Least Recently Used
 * algorithm to remove items from the Map when the maximum size is reached and new items are added.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A synchronized version can be obtained with:
 * <code>Collections.synchronizedMap( theMapToSynchronize )</code>
 * If it will be accessed by multiple threads, you _must_ synchronize access
 * to this Map.  Even concurrent get(Object) operations produce indeterminate
 * behaviour.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Unlike the Collections 1.0 version, this version of LRUMap does use a true
 * LRU algorithm.  The keys for all gets and puts are moved to the front of
 * the list.  LRUMap is now a subclass of SequencedHashMap, and the "LRU"
 * key is now equivalent to LRUMap.getFirst().
 * </p>
