The org.apache.axis.description package is a proposed set of 
interfaces for incorporating Service Description mechanisms into
Axis.  This is intended to replace the ServiceDescription class
that is in the org.apache.axis.encoding package and to provide
a far more flexible, pluggable, extensible mechanism.  

I don't plan on implementing this soon.  The classes are here
because I needed the one of the classes in the 
org.apache.axis.deployment package depends on the ServiceDescription
class.
