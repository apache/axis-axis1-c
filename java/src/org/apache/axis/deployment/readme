The org.apache.axis.deployment package is still experimental
and has not yet been completely plugged into the rest of the
Axis code base.  

To plug this code into Axis, changes need to be made to the
AxisServer and AxisServlet classes in the areas that deal with
locating and instantiating services for invocation.  

The SimpleDeploymentManager is the default deployment registry.



NOTE: This package supercedes the code provided for in the 
org.apache.axis.registries and org.apache.axis.suppliers 
package.  When this code is finally plugged into everything else, 
both packages will go away.


org.apache.axis.deployment.wsdd -
   This is an implementation of the new WSDD Schema that will
   be the primary method of deploying services and defining
   chains/flows of handlers within Axis.

org.apache.axis.deployment.v2dd -
   This is an implementation the the Apache SOAP v2.x Deployment
   Descriptor.  This package allows developers to use their 
   existing SOAP deployment packages with Axis without requiring
   the deployment descriptor to be upgraded to the new WSDD
   schema.  It's not quite finished yet tough
   
org.apache.axis.deployment.wsml -
   This will be an implementation of the Web Services Mapping
   Language schema that is used by the Microsoft SOAP Toolkit
   Version 2.  The goal is to support the migration of COM
   based services to Axis from Microsoft SOAP Toolkit Beta 2
   without forcing the developers to convert their WSML files
   to WSDD.  (WSML is the Microsoft SOAP Toolkit equivalent
   to a deployment descriptor).
