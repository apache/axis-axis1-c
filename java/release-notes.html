<h2>Axis Beta 1 Release Notes</h2>

<p>This is the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis/releases.html"> beta 1 release</a> 
  of the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis"> Axis SOAP library</a>. (Wondering 
  what Axis is? Please see our <a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis/faq.html">FAQ</a>.)</p>
<h3>General Beta 1 Information</h3>

<p>This is a beta release.  Most of the functionality is there.  There is still a chance that a few interfaces may change, but we will do our best to keep that from happening.  See the User's Guide for a list of the published interfaces that we believe are stable.  This beta release is closer to JAX-RPC compliance than the alpha, but JAX-RPC is still a moving target, so those interfaces still have the potential to change.</p>

<p>Why AXIS over SOAP 2.2?  The Axis code has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Significantly higher performance than Apache SOAP 2.2 
  <li>Good interoperability with other SOAP implementations 
  <li>A streaming-oriented model for message parsing (SAX, not DOM) 
  <li>A modular, configurable message handling architecture 
  <li>A pluggable transport framework 
  <li>Support for WSDL generation and code generation from WSDL
  <li>An extensive package and functional test suite 
</ul>

<p>Early adopters and advanced SOAP developers will find this release to be of 
  interest. Most Apache SOAP users, and those who need a fully featured next-version 
  replacement for Apache SOAP 2.2, may wish to use this beta, but they should be aware that, as a beta, functionality and interfaces may change, though we will do our best to minimize the impact of such changes.</p>
<h3>What's New?</h3>
<p>Changes since alpha-3:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Closer to JAX-RPC compliance.</li>
  <li>Support for <A href="docs/user-guide.html#AttachmentsReference">SOAP Messages with Attachments</a>.</li>
  <li>Much better XML schema type support.</li>
  <li>Document/literal support.</li>
  <li>Now using the org.apache.commons.logging APIs as a common logging interface.</li>
  <li>Many minor bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
