<h2>Axis 1.1 RC2 Release Notes</h2>

<p>This is the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis/releases.html">1.1 RC2 release</a> 
  of the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis"> Axis SOAP library</a>.</p>

<h3>About this release</h3>
<p>1.1 RC2 is being released to get ready to release 1.1 in March. This release 
  serves to get recent bugfixes and improvements out into the testing community 
  so that 1.1 final can be as good as possible. Please bang on the APIs, kick 
  the tires, and let us know about any problems you have!</p>
<hr>
<em>(the following are older release notes which will be moved for the final 1.1 
release)</em> 
<h3>Rationale for Releasing Axis 1.0</h3>


Many users have requested a v1.0 so that they can work from a relatively
stable base. Some users have even remained on Apache SOAP until v1.0 of
Axis is available. Now Axis has surpassed Apache SOAP in function,
performance, and interoperability and, in particular, has passed Sun's
JAX-RPC and SAAJ compliance tests, we decided to ship v1.0 as it
currently stands.
<p>
However, this is far from the end of the road for Axis: there is more
documentation to be written; the SOAP v1.2 spec. needs to be tracked to
completion and implemented fully; major functional enhancements and
architectural improvements are being considered. We particularly encourage
you to submit improvements to the documentation, however large or small and
in any format, to axis-dev@xml.apache.org. Also, interoperability
is always a concern, so please report all <i>replicatable</i> bugs.</p>

<h3>JAX-RPC</h3>
<p>This release is intended to be 100% compliant with the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxrpc">JAX-RPC</a> and
<a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/saaj/">SAAJ</a> specifications from Sun.
The Axis code has successfully passed the all of the JAX-RPC and SAAJ
TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit) tests.</p>

<h3>Why AXIS over SOAP 2.2?</h3>

<p>The Axis code has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Significantly higher performance than Apache SOAP 2.2 
  <li>Good interoperability with other SOAP implementations 
  <li>A streaming-oriented model for message parsing (SAX, not DOM) 
  <li>A modular, configurable message handling architecture 
  <li>A pluggable transport framework 
  <li>Support for WSDL generation and code generation from WSDL 
  <li>An extensive package and functional test suite 
</ul>
