<h2>Axis 1.0 RC1 Release Notes</h2>

<p>This is the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis/releases.html">RC1 release</a> 
  of the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis"> Axis SOAP library</a>.</p>

<h3>General 1.0 RC1 Information</h3>

<p>This is a near-final release.  We believe Axis is suitable for use in
production systems.  While we know there may be outstanding bugs, the
functionality and features are sufficiently complete that a 1.0 release is warrented.
See the User's Guide for a list of the published interfaces that we believe are stable.</p>

<h3>JAX-RPC</h3>
<p>This release is intended to be 100% compliant with the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxrpc">JAX-RPC</a> and 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/saaj/">SAAJ</a> specifications from Sun.
The Axis code has successfully passed the all of the JAX-RPC and SAAJ 
TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit) tests.</p>

  <li>A modular, configurable message handling architecture
