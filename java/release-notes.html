<h2>Axis Alpha 2 Release Notes</h2>

<p>This is the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis/releases.html"> alpha 2 release</a> 
  of the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis"> Axis SOAP library</a>. (Wondering 
  what Axis is? Please see our <a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis/faq.html">FAQ</a>.)</p>
<h3>General Alpha Information</h3>

<p>This is an alpha release, and hence is not feature complete.  The main
missing features include:</p>

<ul>
<li>No support for SOAP attachments
<li>Deployment syntax not finalized
<li>Incomplete Apache SOAP 2.2 deployment descriptor support
<li>Minimal testing in EJB / application server frameworks
  <li>No support for XML-RPC, SMTP 
  <li>Limited documentation
</ul>

<p>The Axis team is working on all of these missing features.</p>

<p>So, why an alpha release?</p>

<p>The Axis code already has:</p>

<ul>
<li>Significantly higher performance than Apache SOAP 2.2
<li>Good interoperability with other SOAP implementations
<li>A streaming-oriented model for message parsing (SAX, not DOM)
<li>A modular, configurable message handling architecture
<li>A pluggable transport framework
<li>An extensive package and functional test suite
</ul>

<p>Early adopters and advanced SOAP developers will find this release to be of 
  interest. Most Apache SOAP users, and those who need a fully featured next-version 
  replacement for Apache SOAP 2.2, should hold off at least until Axis's beta 
  release. Progress towards that beta release may be viewed on Axis's <a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis/requirements.html"> 
  requirements and status page</a>.</p>
<h3>What's New?</h3>
<p>Changes since alpha-1:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for auto-generating WSDL from any URL-accessible service (i.e. 
    JWS services)!</li>
  <li>Added a Wsdl2java tool for building Axis stubs and skeletons from WSDL files!</li>
  <li>SimpleAxisServer now supports HTTP basic authentication</li>
  <li>Revamp authentication handlers to use an extensible &quot;security provider&quot; 
    interface, which should allow easy integration with existing security providers 
    such as those provided by application servers. A basic version and a version 
    which uses servlet 2.2 authentication are both provided.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
