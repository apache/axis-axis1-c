<h2>Axis 1.1 Release Notes</h2>

<p>This is the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis/releases.html">1.1 release</a> 
  of the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis"> Axis SOAP library</a>.</p>

<h3>About this release</h3>
<p>This release is primarily an upgrade to fix a number of bugs in the 1.0 release. 
  Since it took longer than we expected, you'll also find a bunch of new features 
  in there.</p>
<p>We still have a *lot* of <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/">open 
  bugs</a> on the books, so please realize that this is not a completely polished 
  work yet. After 1.1 ships we hope / plan to do a lot of work cleaning things 
  up and adding some much-needed functionality which is currently missing, in 
  hopes of releasing a much better 1.2 release in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p>We say this a lot, but it's worth repeating - you can help! If you've got coding 
  skill, interest, and a little free time, we'd love to have you join the Axis 
  community and help make the product better - see below.</p>
<h3>Changes From 1.0 to 1.1</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Vastly improved SOAP 1.2 support</li>
  <li>Added an email transport</li>
  <li>Added serializers/deserializers for Castor compatibility</li>
  <li>Improved WSDL schema generation APIs for custom types</li>
  <li>Misnamed org.apache.axis.encoding.DefaultSOAP12TypeMappingImpl is now called 
    DefaultSOAPEncodingTypeMappingImpl</li>
  <li>Added CORBA and RMI providers</li>
  <li>Improved EJBProvider's ability to be a &quot;good EJB citizen&quot;</li>
  <li>Improved multiref deserialization code</li>
  <li>Improved fault handling and serialization / deserialization</li>
  <li>Various bugfixes</li>
</ul>
<p>However, this is far from the end of the road for Axis: there is more documentation 
  to be written, and major functional enhancements and architectural improvements 
  are being considered.</p>
<h3>JAX-RPC</h3>
<p>This release is intended to be 100% compliant with the <a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxrpc">JAX-RPC</a> 
  and <a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/saaj/">SAAJ</a> specifications from Sun. 
  The Axis code has successfully passed the all of the JAX-RPC and SAAJ TCK (Technology 
  Compatibility Kit) tests.</p>
<h3>More Info</h3>

<p>Please check out the included documentation and the <a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis/faq.html">FAQ</a> 
  for more information.</p>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>Coding, testing, and helping to answer questions on axis-user are all greatly 
  appreciated. We particularly encourage you to submit improvements to the documentation, 
  however large or small and in any format, to axis-dev@xml.apache.org. Also, 
  interoperability is always a concern, so please report all <i>replicable</i> 
  bugs.</p>
<p>Thanks for your interest in Axis!</p>
