To run cppunit tests you  need to install cppunit in your matchine
I installed cppunit-1.10.2.tar.gz
Then create CPPUNIT_HOME environment variable pointing to your installation location
When you configure, by default testcases are not added to the build.
So to build testcases and cpp unit tests you need to add the configure option
configure --enable-testcases
When running the tests you might need to run the test server for some tests(for
example to run Axis2TransportTest you need this). Please refer to 
tests/utils/simple-server-client/readme to do that.


To add new cpp unit tests follow the steps given below
I explain this using a test already added
I wanted to write a testcase to test Axis2Transport's getBytes method
I added Axis2TransportTest.hpp class in transport/axis2 folder
Note that file name is just adding Test suffix to AxisTransport.
Also note that we maintain the same folder structure as the source
file structure.
Inside it I write TestGetByte which is my test method.
Then in runCppUnitTests.cpp I add

#include "transport/axis2/Axis2TransportTest.hpp"

After that we add the test as follows

    suiteOfTests->addTest( new CppUnit::TestCaller<Axis2TransportTest>( 
        "testGetBytes", 
	&Axis2TransportTest::testGetBytes ) );

That's it.
