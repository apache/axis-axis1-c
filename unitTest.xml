		This file runs what we have termed the "unit tests". They are not unit tests in a true sense of the word rather they run a set of 
		tests against a "mock server". This is a Java program that given a request will return back a given response file. Thus this system is useful for
		testing where we do not have an actual service written but have the tcp monitor request and response files. From these we can write a test quickly and easily and place it into
		the unit test suite which avoids us having to create a large number of potentially complex services when time might not allow this.
			
		This system is essentially the same as the fv suite except for the fact that the endpoint is not
		a server but the mock-server. In order to run this system several things have to be set up in advance e.g.
		the response files. For more inforamtion about set up of a new test please read the document ws-axis/c/tests/auto_build/UnitTest_Readme.txt.
		
		In order to run the already created unit tests please run Ant against this build file giving the same properties as you do for 
		the fv suite in order for the suite to find your libraries. NOTE: This system does not handle ssl tests.

			This target calls the fv suite as usual except for the fact that unit test flags
				and properties are switched on.
			This means that the client is being used against a fake server and the unitTest.list file is used
				instead of any *test.list* property set by the user
