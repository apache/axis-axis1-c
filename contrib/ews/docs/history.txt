JAX-RPC-MAPPER
==============
After the 2nd refactoring - written by Ias (iasandcb@tmax.co.kr)

I've been also concerned with this issue for a long time. Jongjin, my colleague, 
and I discussed it a lot and concluded that JAX-RPC mapper should be refactored 
again. (The mapper on ews project is the first refactored work.)
We agreed that Java-relevant information from SymbolTable had to be mapped from 
and to JAX-RPC mapping file just after it was populated. In other words, 
J2eeGeneratorFactory will handle all the mapping chores and each writer will 
use the mapped information without individual mapping procedure. If it's 
accomplished, J2eeXxxWriters are deprecated except J2eeDeployWriter, 
which is not yet provided but the most wanted by Geronimo. 

This second refactoring is supposed to enable you to get mapped information 
on Java side after J2eeEmitter.run has finished.

Rule:
If there's no mapping for a given key, JaxRpcMapper returns null at the times.
