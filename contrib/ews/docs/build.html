<h1>Building EWS</h1>

To build EWS use maven. 
<ul>
<li>Download and install  maven</li>
<li>Check out EWS code from the <a href="ws.apache.org/axis/cvs.html">ws-axis/contrib/ews</a></li>
<li>cd to the project dir and type one of the following command to build the project.
<code>maven or maven jar</code></li> 

<li><code>maven –o</code> 
Used for offline build (you need to have the jar’s at the repository to do the offline build. But if you are build it in some machine copy the .maven dir and put it in the right place in the machine you want to build in than use –o option. But be careful for the outdated files.)</li>
<li>if you are behind a firewall create a build.properties file in the home dir with following entries</li>
<br>
<code> 
maven.proxy.host = cache.mrt.ac.lk (put your proxy)<br>
maven.proxy.port = 3128 (put your port)<br>
</code>
</br>
