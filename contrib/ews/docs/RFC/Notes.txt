2.1.1 Client Model Goals
The client programming model should be conformant and compatible with the client programming model
defined by JAX-RPC.
Additional goals for the client programming model are to ensure that:
• Programmers can implement Web services client applications conforming to this specification that may
reside in a J2EE container (e.g. an EJB that uses a Web service), or a J2EE Client Container can call a
Web service running in a Web Services for J2EE container.
• Client applications conforming to this specification can call any SOAP 1.1 based Web service through
the HTTP 1.1 or HTTPS SOAP Bindings.
• Programmers using other client environments such as Java 2 Standard Edition environment can call a
Web service running in a Web Services for J2EE container. Programmers using languages other than
Java must be able to implement SOAP 1.1 compliant applications that can use Web services conforming
to this specification. Support the Client Development Scenarios described in Chapter 4.
• Client developers must not have to be aware of how the service implementation is realized.
• Java 2 Micro Edition clients, defined by JSR 172, should be able to interoperate using the transport
standards declared within WSDL and the JAX-RPC runtime with Web Services for J2EE applications.
