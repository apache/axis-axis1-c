1) remove the javax.xml.namespace.* from the code as when it is there the code 
fail  saying the signature of the file does not match with sun WSDP jar's

2) the genarated code return the null for the operation name 

3) in generation of the BindingImpl class is the filing up the implementation of the 
each method is Richards job(6). We have to help him to clarify how he should do it.
(inside the JAXRPCMapper or the ws4j2ee) and specify that how he can  get the acsess 
to the data he want to have.

4) the client side genarated class should have the JAXR support

5) if the handlers are specified in the webservice.xml file they should  be 
specified in the deploy.wsdd file.

6) in the deploy.wsdd file the provider should specify as java:j2ee 
(this is nessasary to gain acsess to the message context.)


** Ias what do you Think
	1) keep the jaxrpc mapper separated form the ws4jee or move the
	   jaxrpc mapper in to the ws4j2ee. If you like to keep jaxrpcmapper 
	   standalone we should found how to adress 4/5
	   
	2) I saw that the jaxrpc mapper work on top of *Entry of symbol table.
		e.g. BindingEntry rather than javax.wsdl.Binding. is there is any 
		chance of making it work on the javax.wsdl.* stuff.
		(sake of giving a better interface ;-)
