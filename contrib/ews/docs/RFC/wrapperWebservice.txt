this is something like the 
com.jwsbook.jaxrpc.BookQuoteBindingImpl.java

the signaure and the skelton of the class is genarated by the Ias.
But the most important part is filing the implentation. We have to decide 
where we going to do it. Basically Richard will decide where to do it.

	I see two options 
	1) if jaxrpc mapper is not standalone do the filing of implementation in the 
	   Emitter inside the jaxrpc mapper.
	2) else do it just as org.apache.x.ws4j2ee.toWs.handlers.HandlerWriter is done.
		Basically the 
		
	    public class HandlerWriter extends AbstractWriter {
	    	public HandlerWriter(J2EEWebServiceContext j2eewscontext){
		    }
		    public void writeCode() throws GenerationFault {
		    	super.writeCode();
		    	out.write("..........")
		    	//print the file here
    		}
       	}
		
		
		user can have J2eeWebServiceContext Object and print the file 
		out in the writeCode()
		
TIPS
====

1) to acsses the MessageContext (which have the all the information about the
current webservice that is executing in axis) org.apache.x.ws4j2ee.wsutils.JaxRpcRuntime.
getMessageContext() static method.

2) to acsess the ServiceEntry, BindingEntry and the PortTypeEntry of the 
webservice under consideration we can use MiscInfo obect (acsess via getMiscInfo()
of J2EEWebServiceContext)

3) to get the QName -> java type mapping we can use JaxRpcMapperContext get by 
getJAXRPCMappingContext() of the J2EEWebServiceContext. we can have all the information 
using combination of Binding,PortType,Operations and JAXRPCMappingContext mapping methods 
to get mapping.
