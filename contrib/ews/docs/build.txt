===========================

1. Configure src/schema/sun-ri.properties
3. Run maven from ews directory.

Please see run.txt to test your JAX-RPC mapper.


How to build ws4j2ee
===========================

written by Srinath Perera(hemapani@opensource.lk)

to compile the ws4j2ee
1) check out jaxrpcmapper and ws4j2ee
2) copy the both to the same dir
3) genarate the jaxrpcmapper.xml -> java binding using the 
jaxrpcmapper. (In other words build the jaxrpc mapper with the Ias's instructions)
4) add all the jar you need with jaxrpcmapper compiling  to the 
classpath. (have j2ee.jar to compile the sample)
5) you need to have the JWSDP (until jaxme is done ).. specify the 
parameters in the ws4j2ee/schemas/sun-ri.properties (JWSDP home)
6) cd to ws4j2ee and "ant" command will compile the code
7) ant jar will create a jar file as well


use IDE (I used eclipse ):
in the processing the binding for the JAXB will created and it genarate a 
dd.jar file and copy it to the lib. If you need to use a IDE please run the
ws4j2ee/schemas/build.xml and get the dd.jar and put it to the classpath.

have the jax-rpc-mapper/src/core, jaxrpcmapper/build/bind and ws4j2ee/src
files in the src path and the jars in the class path

to run:
java org.apache.geronimo.ews.ws4j2ee.toWs.Ws4J2EEwithWSDL C:/sf/ews/ews/src/samples/jaxrpc/book/webservice.xml -ogencode/server

this will genarate the java files plus a ant build.xml file. After filling the 
implementation in ejb without changing the place where it is genarated you can use 
build file to build the distribution.

org.apache.x.ws4j2ee.toWs.Ws4J2EEwithOutWSDL <options-accepted by the java2WSDL>

this will genarated DD and the java classes. (I do not test this much though ..)


sample of genarated code is in the samples
