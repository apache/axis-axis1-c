Axis J2ME XML - JSR 172 J2ME Web Services XML implementation

This implementation is based on NanoXML 2.2.3 hosted at http://sourceforge.net/projects/nanoxml/.
However, NanoXML didn't support SAX2 and were not compliant with J2ME Web Services XML spec, so you can guess that there's a lot of changes from it to Axis J2ME XML.

NanoXML's license is the zlib/libpng License and you can read it at http://nanoxml.sourceforge.net/orig/copyright.html and NanoXML.LICENSE in this directory.

Axis J2ME XML is tested on Zaurus SL760 (device, CDC 1.0).

At last, I'd like to express my gratitude to Marc De Scheemaecker for allowing me great fundamental and inspiration.

More documentation will be post for building and testing.

Looking forward to your help,

Ias
