This early JSR-181 implementation for Axis requires

Ant 1.6.1 (http://ant.apache.org)
Axis 1.2 Beta (http://ws.apache.org/axis)
JWSDP 1.3 (http://java.sun.com/webservices/jwsdp)
J2SE 1.5.0 Beta 2 (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0)
JSR-181 ED (http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=181)

First, configure your own build.properties from build.properties.sample.
Second, set JAVA_HOME to your Tiger home.
Third, extract jsr181-src.jar in the JSR-181 ED to src directory.
(Note that checking the source codes in the jar in this CVS is not yet confirmed by JSR 181 authority. Thanks in advance for your inconvenience for a while.)
At last, simply run "ant" :-)
