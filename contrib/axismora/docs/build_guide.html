<h1>Build Guide</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This guides you through the process of building Axis-MORA. It starts off with the process of building axismora with just the bare required jars. It will also have a recommended version of the component to use.
</p>

<h2>Recommended Environment</h2>
<ul>
<li>JDK Version - 1.4.0+</li>
<li>Ant Version - 1.5.1 </li>
</ul>

<h2>Building with following required component</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Download the axis-Mora project from the cvs.<br>
       we call the root directory MORA_HOME</li>

  <li>Download the following jars.<br>
	<p>Download axis1.1 distribution from the http://ws.apache.org/axis/releases.html and copy the</p>
    <ul>
    <li>axis.jar (axis1.1)</li>
    <li>axis-ant.jar</li>
    <li>wsdl4j.jar</li>
    <li>saaj.jar</li>
    <li>jaxrpc.jar</li>
    <li>commons-discovery.jar</li>
    <li>commons-logging.jar</li>
    <li>log4j-1.2.8.jar</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
	from the lib folder to the MORA_HOME/lib</li>

   <li> Download the activation.jar.<br>
	You can download this from
       http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/glasgow/jaf.html</li>

   <li> Download xercesImpl.jar , xmlApis.jar and xmlParserAPIs.jar<br>

      You can download this from
      http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j/.</li>
   <li>you will need to add junit.jar to your lib directory.<br>

      You can download this from http://www.junit.org/index.htm Recommended version: 3.8 +.</li>
   <li>Download the xpp3-1.1.3.2.jar.<br>
        You can download this from
        http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/xpp/</li>

  <li> Download the servlet.jar.<br>

    You can download this from
    http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/

Or you can get this jar from <tomcat_Home>\common \lib\servlet.jar

http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-tomcat-4.0/release/v4.1.12/bin/jakarta-tomcat-4.1.12.zip

Recommended version: 2.2 or 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>Keep all these jars in the <MORA_HOME>/lib/. Then you can start your Building journey on the axis-MORA.</p>
<ul>
    <li>To build you need to have ant1.5+ in your machine.Copy the junit.jar to the ant lib</li>
    <li>Make sure ant optional jar and axis-ant jar is also in your ant lib</li>
    <li>To build you can use command "ant build-all" it will compile everything. it will create a build/webapps/axismora directory. you can copy the aixsmora directory tomcat in the tomcat. When you start the tomcat the axismora will be listening on http://<host>:<port>/axismora/servlet/AxisServlet.</li>
    <li>To compile src only (without samples / tests) use ant compile</li>
    <li>You can run functional tests with "ant functional-tests".</li>
    <li>with the axismora runing on port 8080 you can run set of usage tests with ant -f usagetests.xml</li>
</ul>

Note<br>
<p>you must run the ant tasks while you are at the MORA_HOME.</p>
<p>Congratulation now you have axismora up and running. Please note that if you need to deploy your own service in axismora you should generates a wrapper for this service. To do this we have tool called WSDL2Ws with axismora. It accept wsdl file to generate the wrapper.(tool to do it with a java class will be comeing shortly.) To learn how to use it please have a look at the example3 at user guide.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you are new to this axis-mora please refer to the User guide.</li>
    <li>For developing in axis-mora please refer to the Developer guide</li>
    <li>If you have problems building or using Ant, start on the Ant problems page</li>
    <li>If you have any problem in building process please look at the FAQ</li>
    <li>if you want to test the axismora without tomcat you may use org.apache.axismora.server.SimpleAxisServer. (make sure to keep mora-config.wsdd file in the same directory as you start the server)</li>
 </ul>
