create environment variable TXPP_HOME to point where
txpp source is.
TXPP_HOME="/home/foo/txpp"

export TXPP_HOME

Now
cd $TXPP_HOME

to build

./configure --prefix=<your install dir, say inst-dir>

make

make install

This will install libtxpp.so in $TXPP_HOME/lib

By default tests are also built and installed in
$TXPP_HOME/bin. If you don't want tests to build,
give the configure option 
configure --enable-tests=no

To run the tests

cd inst-dir/bin

sh run_test1.sh
sh run_test2.sh
