 *    The SOAP Body of a SOAP Envelope according to SOAP 1.2 specification.
 *
 *    A SOAP body provides a mechanism for transmitting information to an ultimate SOAP receiver.
 *  The Body element information item has:
 *        - A [local name] of Body .
 *        - A [namespace name] of "http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope".
 *        - Zero or more namespace qualified attribute information items in its [attributes] property.
 *        - Zero or more namespace qualified element information items in its [children] property.
 *
 *  The Body element information item MAY have any number of character information item children whose
 *  character code is amongst the white space characters as defined by XML 1.0 [XML 1.0]. These are
 *  considered significant.
 *
 *  SOAP Body child Element:
 *  All child element information items of the SOAP Body element information item:
 *        - SHOULD have a [namespace name] property which has a value, that is the name of the element
 *          SHOULD be namespace qualified.
 *        - MAY have any number of character information item children. Child character information
 *          items whose character code is amongst the white space characters as defined by XML 1.0 [XML 1.0]
 *          are considered significant.

 *          namespace qualified.
 *        - MAY have zero or more attribute information items in its [attributes] property. Among these MAY
