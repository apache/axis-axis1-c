This directory contains proposals for adding async request/response
client and transport mechanisms into Axis.


Proposal 1: Sonic JMS Transport 

   (Sonic folks... please provide a basic short description
    of what you're looking to provide)
    
Proposal 2: Async req/resp api mods to Call object +
            Pluggable async processing impl support
            
   Makes several simple modifications to org.apache.axis.client.Call
   that allows developers to do async req/resp. 
   
   // e.g. //
   call.setProperty(ASYNC_CALL_PROPERTY, new Boolean(true));
   call.invoke(parms);
   call.waitForReturnValue(1000 * 10);  // wait 10 seconds
   
   Also provides a simple framework for plugging in async processing
   impl's on the client side.
