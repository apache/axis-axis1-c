                           TO DO LIST FOR AXIS C++
                           -----------------------

Please help to maintain this file, as accuracy is critical.  Major topic
areas are headed by section headings, and individual items are prefixed
with "!" (needs doing) "*" (in progress) or "X" (done), followed by the
owner (if any) in "<>" brackets. Also the priority order is postfixed with
a number where 0 - least priority. Example:

                 *2 <Glen> Write TO DO list //2 is the priority

! <team> Update the TO DO list to be current!


MESSAGE PARSING / ENCODING
--------------------------
! <team> 	Improving the SoapDeserializer to parse SOAP headers
! <team> 	Changing SAX2 parser to use progressive parsing and then adopt XMLpull parsing

CLIENT API
----------

SCHEMA SUPPORT
--------------

SOAP 1.1 SUPPORT
----------------


SOAP 1.2 SUPPORT
-----------------

! <team> 	Change the SOAP header coding
! <team> 	Change the SOAP fault coding


PERFORMANCE
-----------
! <team>	Improving Serializer code so that it avoids string operations(+= operator etc)
		Directly calling Transport's function (eg: ap_rputs(..))
DOCUMENTATION
-------------
* <damitha> 	writing Integration-guide
! <team> 	writing user-guide
! <team> 	writing handler API

SAMPLES
-------
! <team> 	WSDL documents for sample web services
* <susantha>	Writing 2 web services for SOAPBuilders interop tests 
		1. Round 2 base and
		2. Round 2 Group B

WSDL2C++
---------

AXISDEPLOY
----------
! <team>	WrapperClassGenerator 
		1. writing a set of classes that can store information that parser obtains by 
		   parsing the user web service's include files.
		2. writing c++ parser that reads and parses the web service's include files

GENERAL / UNCATEGORIZED
-----------------------

! <team>	In the WSDDDocument.cpp for each and every XMLString::transcode() you have to 
		use a corrosponding XMLString::release() to relase the allocated memeory

! <team>	In the WSDDDocument.cpp write the code to handle the end element for wsdd_resflow

* <susantha> 	Improve AxisEngine to send back the WSDL upon http GET request. Ex. http://url/service?wsdl

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
-------------------

! <team> 	Currently the keywords which are namespace specific are hard coded. We have to
		put these keywords in to a list/map and pickup them when ever needed from it.
		eg: 
		a) enc
		   http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-encoding
		   float, double, .... etc
		   
! <team> 	The current code supports only int, float, string out of simple types. This code
		has to be improved to support other simplet types as well.

* <susantha>	Implementing C++ types for xml types (datetime, date, time, HexBinary, Base64Binary etc)
		and improve Param class to support them.
