                                                   TO DO LIST FOR AXIS C++
                                                   -----------------------
Please help to maintain this file, as accuracy is critical. Major topic areas are
headed by section headings, and individual items are prefixed with "!" (needs doing) 
"*" (in progress) or "X" (done), followed by the owner (if any) in "<>" brackets. 
Also the priority order is postfixed with a number where 0-least priority. 
	Example:
                 *2 <Glen> Write TO DO list //2 is the priority

! <team> Update the TO DO list to be current!

MESSAGE PARSING / ENCODING
--------------------------
! <team> 	Improving the SoapDeserializer to parse SOAP headers
! <team> 	Research on XML pull C++ API any applying that to Axis C++ if possible.
X <susantha> 	Improving Deserializer/Serializer and related area to support multi-dimensional arrays 
* <team> 	Improving Deserializer/Serializer and related area to support partially transmitted arrays 

CLIENT API
----------
! <team> 	Discussion and documentation on client side of Axis C++.

SCHEMA SUPPORT
--------------

SOAP 1.1 SUPPORT
----------------

SOAP 1.2 SUPPORT
-----------------
* <roshan> 	Change the SOAP header coding
* <roshan> 	Change the SOAP fault coding
* <roshan> 	Change the SOAP body coding

PERFORMANCE
-----------
X <roshan>	Improving Serializer code so that it avoids string operations(+= operator etc)		
		Directly calling Transport's function (eg: ap_rputs(..))
X <susantha> 	With the current method of writing a web service wrapper class every web service
		DLL (or .so) will have its own copy of Serializer/Deserializer code (statically bound).
		Result is that the web service DLL is too large with unnecessarily linked code (more memory).
		So we have to make Serializer/Deserializer code to a DLL and then every web service and the
		Axis engine uses the same DLL.
! <team> 	going through the Axis C++ code and minimize the usage of STL as much as possible (specially std::string)
* <susantha> 	Improving the code in XMLStreamHandler.cpp to avoid XMLString::transcode

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
* <damitha> 	writing Integration-guide
! <team> 	writing user-guide
! <team> 	writing handler API
X <susantha>    improving developer-guide with Transport Module writing API
! <team>    	updating developer-guide to reflect new Transport Module writing API
! <team> 	Writing a documentation (5000 letters) on Axis C++ to be published in any news letter.
! <team> 	Developing the web site for Axis C++.
! <team>	Writing coding standard document for Axis C++ project.

SAMPLES
-------
! <team> 	WSDL documents for sample web services
* <susantha>	Writing 2 web services for SOAPBuilders interop tests 
		1. Round 2 base and
		2. Round 2 Group B

WSDL2C++
---------
! <team> 	Coding C++ generation part of WSDL2WS tool being written in Java.

Deployment
----------
X <susantha>	WrapperClassGenerator 		
		1. writing a set of classes that can store information that parser obtains by 		   
		   parsing the user web service's include files.		
		2. writing c++ parser that reads and parses the web service's include files
! <team>	Improving the WCG to remove the web service writing C++ restrictions one by one
! <team> 	Writing a webservice and the client for the Administration of Axis. Similar to the AdminClient in Axis Java.
! <team> 	Improving WSDD module so that dynamic deployment/undeployment can be done.

GENERAL / UNCATEGORIZED
-----------------------
! <team>	Support for internationalization require you to handle user data with unicodes so
		replace std::string with std::wstring & char * with wchar_t* where user data is handled.
! <team> 	Refactor AxisEngine to make it suitable for Server side & Client side seperatly
		so that we can derive AxisServer & AxisClient from that and no duplication result in.
! <team>	Clean seperation would be required between XML writing & reading so that we can easily 
		plug in different XML parsing mechanisms.
! <team> 	Better if we can introduce namespaces to avoid collisions between names when the 
		server/client side is link with user code. Hence, better to focus it now rather than later.		
X <Susantha> 	Avoid using any global variables to make the server thread safe.	
! <team>	Pluggable provider APIs to support RPC/Document styles.
		
X <sanjaya>	In the WSDDDocument.cpp for each and every XMLString::transcode() you have to 
		use a corrosponding XMLString::release() to relase the allocated memeory

X <sanjaya>	In the WSDDDocument.cpp write the code to handle the end element for wsdd_resflow
X <sanjaya> 	Improve AxisEngine to send back the WSDL upon http GET request. Ex. http://url/service?wsdl
! <team> 	Support SOAP messages with attachments: defines a binding for a SOAP message to be carried 
		within a MIME multipart/related message.
! <lilantha>	Servlet support for server side which helps to deploy server in a servlet containers or in
		J2EE servers & ISAPI extension for server to deploy it in IIS.

Session
-------
! <team> 	SOAP session support
! <team> 	A sample for a SOAP session handler
X <susantha> 	Transport session support (Ex: HTTP)

Transport
---------
! <team> 	Pluggable transport API for server & client, seperate interfaces between Transport & 
		other stuff.
! <team> 	Support for "SOAP messages with attachments"
! <team>
		Development of following transport modules and testing them
			1. Apache 1.3 for linux
			2. IIS
			3. Apache 2.0 for windows and Linux
			4. globus XIO
Security
--------
! <team> 	Support transport-level security
! <team> 	Support SOAP-level security
! <team> 	Support for existing security SOAP-level standards
! <team> 	A sample for a SOAP Basic Authentication handler

Service Description and Discovery (WSDL)
----------------------------------------
X <sanjaya> 	Support a basic html page describing the service (via an HTTP GET)
* <nadika> 	Tools and/or run-time support for stub generation from WSDL

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
-------------------
X <susantha> 	Currently the keywords which are namespace specific are hard coded. We have to		
		put these keywords in to a list/map and pickup them when ever needed from it.		
		eg: 		
			a) enc		   http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-encoding		   
			   		   
* <damitha> 	The current code supports only int, float, string out of simple types. This code		
		has to be improved to support other simplet types as well. float, double, .... etc

* <damitha>	Implementing C++ types for xml types (datetime, date, time, HexBinary, Base64Binary etc)
		and improve Param class to support them.
