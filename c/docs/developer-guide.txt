This document is intended for the developer who wish to download and test the axiscpp server.

Checkout axiscpp from cvs repository.
To build axisengine library
===========================
When you download the source you have only Makfile.am's and configure.ac and
autogen.sh script for building.

make sure you create and  set the environment variable AXISCPP_HOME
to reflect the path to the directory where you downloaded the axiscpp.
for example I have it as following
AXISCPP_HOME="/home/damitha/projects/axiscpp/c" where c is the rood directory
for axiscpp source. There you find autogen.sh, configure.ac etc.

to build go to $AXISCPP_HOME dirctory.
sh autogen.sh

To avoid cluttering of the source with object files use the build directory
to generate your object files.

Now from c/build directory run
sh runconfigure

This will create all the Makefiles in a tree starting from build directory.
make
then
make install

this will install libaxiscpp_mod.so in c/release directory.
copy this to <apache home>/libexec directory and restart apache
to load the axisengine in apache.

Note: in $AXISCPP_HOME/include you have folder called xercesc apache1_3
apache2_0. Copy the corresponding include files into them.

To build samples
=====================
Go to the samples folder
$(AXISCPP_HOME)/src/server/samples
and select the sample you want. As an example we try on
simplewebservice
type the following commands in that order
sh autogen.sh
sh runconfig
make
make install

this will install the sample library in /usr/local/apache/Axis/webservices 

note: the server.wsdd file for this sample has to be put in
/usr/local/apache/Axis/conf folder.
This path is hardcoded in Axis.cpp file as following

#define WSDDFILEPATH "/usr/local/apache/Axis/conf/server.wsdd"
