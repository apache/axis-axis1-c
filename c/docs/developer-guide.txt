This document is intended for the developer who wish to download and test the axiscpp server.

Download the axiscpp.tar.gz from the cvs repository
tar -zxvf axiscpp.tar.gz into your selected folder.
 
create and export an environment variable called
XERCES_HOME. This environment variable should contain the path to the xerces home directory.

For example if your xerces is installed in

/usr/local/xerces_c folder then 
$(XERCES_HOME)/lib should expand to /usr/local/xerces_c/lib and
$(XERCES_HOME)/include should expand to /usr/local/xerces_c/include

cd axiscpp
make clean
make

If the build successful, libaxiscpp.so should have been created in 
axiscpp/release directory.
