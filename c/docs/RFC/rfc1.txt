OPEN ISSUES
-----------
1. We have to discuss about separating the code base to several dynamic link libraries. But we have to
   consider performance bottlenecks. At the moment we have following issues due to non-separation of code
   into several DLLs.
	a. Each Webservice and handler deployed has its own Serializer/Deserializer code statically linked
	   to that DLL (or .so).
	b. If we separate apache plugin module from rest of the axis code and make axis code another shared 
	   object, we may use the same axis .so for other web servers without rebuilding. But this can be a 
	   a performance bottleneck too. what do you think ?.
