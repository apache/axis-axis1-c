
1. Building the Plugin

  To build the plugin, update the version number in the 
  plugin.xml file and run Ant on the build.xml file.  A 
  new directory called org.apache.axis_${axis_version}
  (where ${axis_version} == the current version of Axis
  as set in the xml-axis/java/xmls/properties.xml file)
  will be created and all of the appropriate files copied.
  
2. Installing the Plugin

  To install the plugin, simply copy the org.apache.axis_${axis_version}
  to the %ECLIPSE_HOME%/plugins directory and restart your
  Eclipse workbench.
  
3. Using the Plugin

  This Plugin allows other Eclipse Plugins to make use of
  Axis' Web services, SOAP and WSDL support.  When creating 
  a new Plugin project, simply set a dependency on this
  plugin and the classpath will be set accordingly.
  

  Have fun! :-)
