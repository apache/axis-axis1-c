    <p>
      Most users of the source code probably don't need to have day
      to day access to the source code as it changes. For these
      users we provide easy to unpack source code downloads via our
      <link href="releases.html">download pages</link>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><font size="+1">View the Source Tree</font></b><br/>
    </p>
    <p> Latest CVS sources can be viewed at <link href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/ws-axis/">http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/ws-axis/</link>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><font size="+1">Access the Source Tree
      (AnonCVS)</font></b><br />
       So, you've decided that you need access to the source tree
      to see the latest and greatest code. There's two different
      forms of CVS access. The first is anonymous and anybody can
      use it. The second is not and you must have a login to the
      development server. If you don't know what this means, join
      the <link href="mail.html">mailing list</link> and find out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone can checkout source code from our anonymous CVS
      server. To do so, simply use the following commands (if you
      are using a GUI CVS client, configure it appropriatly):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <table width="90%">
        <tr bgcolor="#F2C0F6">
          <td>
            <pre>
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic login
password: anoncvs

cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic checkout ws-axis
</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </blockquote><b><font size="+1">Full Remote CVS
    Access</font></b> <br />
     If you are a <i>Committer</i> and have a login on the Apache
    development server, this section is for you. If you are not a
    Committer, but you want to submit patches or even request
    commit privelages, please see the <link
    href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/guidelines.html">Jakarta
    GuideLines</link> page (we follow the same rules) for more
    information. 
    <p>
      To have full access to the CVS server, you need to follow the
      links depending on the operating system you are using:
