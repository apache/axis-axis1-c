  <H2>Introduction</H2>

  <P>This document describes how to install Apache Axis. It assumes
  you already know how to write and run Java code and are not
  afraid of XML. You should also have an application server or
  servlet engine and be familiar with operating and deploying to
  it. If you need an application server, we recommend <A href=
  "http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Jakarta Tomcat</A>. [If you
  are installing Tomcat, get the latest 4.1.x version, and the full
  distribution, not the LE version for Java 1.4, as that omits the
  Xerces XML parser]. Other servlet engines are supported, provided
  they implement version 2.2 or greater of the servlet API. Note
  also that Axis client and server requires Java 1.3 or later.</P>

  <P>For more details on using Axis, please see the <A href=
  "user-guide.html">user guide</A>.</P>

  <H2>Things you have to know</H2>

  <P>A lot of problems with Axis are encountered by people who are
  new to Java, server-side Java and SOAP. While you can learn about
  SOAP as you go along, writing Axis clients and servers is not the
  right time to be learning foundational Java concepts, such as
  what an array is, or basic application server concepts such as
  how servlets work, and the basics of the HTTP protocol.</P>

  <P>Things you need to know before writing a Web Service:</P>

  <OL>
    <LI>Core Java datatypes, classes and programming concepts.</LI>

    <LI>What threads are, race conditions, thread safety and
    sychronization.</LI>

    <LI>What a classloader is, what hierarchical classloaders are,
    and the common causes of a "ClassNotFoundException".</LI>

    <LI>How to diagnose trouble from exception traces, what a
    NullPointerException (NPE) and other common exceptions are, and
    how to fix them.</LI>

    <LI>What a web application is; what a servlet is, where
    classes, libraries and data go in a web application.</LI>

    <LI>How to start your application server and deploy a web
    application on it.</LI>

    <LI>What a network is, the core concepts of the IP protocol
    suite and the sockets API. Specifically, what is TCP/IP.</LI>

    <LI>What HTTP is. The core protocol and error codes, HTTP
    headers and perhaps the details of basic authentication.</LI>

    <LI>What XML is. Not necessarily how to parse it or anything,
    just what constitutes well-formed and valid XML.</LI>
  </OL>

  <P>Axis and SOAP depends on all these details. If you don't know
  them, Axis (or anyone else's Web Service middleware) is a
  dangerous place to learn. Sooner or later you will be forced to
  discover these details, and there are easier places to learn than
  Axis.</P>

  <P>If you are completely new to Java, we recommend you start off
  with things like the Java Tutorials on Sun's web site, and
  perhaps a classic book like <A href=
  "http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIJ/">Thinking in Java</A>, until
  you have enough of a foundation to be able to work with Axis. It
  is also useful to have written a simple web application, as this
  will give you some knowledge of how HTTP works, and how Java
  application servers integrate with HTTP.</P>

  <P>Be aware that there is a lot more needed to be learned in
  order to use Axis and SOAP effectively than the listing above.
  The other big area is "how to write internet scale distributed
  applications". Nobody knows how to do that properly yet, so that
  you have to learn this by doing.</P>

  <H2>Step 0: Concepts</H2>

  <P>Apache Axis is an Open Source SOAP server and client. SOAP is
  a mechanism for inter-application communication between systems
  written in arbitrary languages, across the Internet. SOAP usually
  exchanges messages over HTTP: the client POSTs a SOAP request,
  and receives either an HTTP success code and a SOAP response or
  an HTTP error code. Open Source means that you get the source,
  but that there is no formal support organisation to help you when
  things go wrong.</P>

  <P>SOAP messages are XML messages. These messages exchange
  structured information between SOAP systems. Messages consist of
  one or more SOAP elements inside an envelope, Headers and the
  SOAP Body. SOAP has two syntaxes for describing the data in these
  elements, <I>Section 5</I>, which is a clear descendant of the
  XML RPC system, and <I>XML Schema</I>, which is the newer (and
  usually better) system. Axis handles the magic of converting Java
  objects to SOAP data when it sends it over the wire or receives
  results. SOAP Faults are sent by the server when something goes
  wrong; Axis converts these to Java exceptions.</P>

  <P>SOAP is intended to link disparate systems. It is not a
  mechanism to tightly bind Java programs written by the same team
  together. It can bind Java programs together, but not as tightly
  as RMI or Corba. If you try sending many Java objects that RMI
  would happily serialize, you will be disappointed at how badly
  Axis fails. This is by design: if Axis copied RMI and serialized
  Java objects to byte streams, you would be stuck to a particular
  version of Java everywhere.</P>

  <P>Axis implements the JAX-RPC API, one of the standard ways to
  program Java services. If you look at the specification and
  tutorials on Sun's web site, you will understand the API. If you
  code to the API, your programs will work with other
  implementations of the API, such as those by Sun and BEA. Axis
  also provides extension features that in many ways extends the
  JAX-RPC API. You can use these to write better programs, but
  these will only work with the Axis implementation. But since Axis
  is free and you get the source, that should not matter.</P>

  <P>Axis is compiled in the JAR file <I>axis.jar</I>; it
  implements the JAX-RPC API declared in the JAR files
  <I>jaxrpc.jar</I> and <I>saaj.jar</I>. It needs various helper
  libraries, for logging, WSDL processing and introspection. All
  these files can be packaged into a web application,
  <I>axis.war</I>, that can be dropped into a servlet container.
  Axis ships with some sample SOAP services. You can add your own
  by adding new compiled classes to the Axis webapp and registering
  them.</P>

  <P>Before you can do that, you have to install it and get it
  working.</P>

  <P><A name="webapp"></A></P>

  <H2>Step 1: Preparing the webapp</H2>

  <P>Here we assume that you have a web server up and running on
  the localhost at port 8080. If your server is on a different
  port, replace references to 8080 to your own port number.</P>

  <P>In your Application Server installation, you should find a
  directory into which web applications ("webapps") are to be
  placed. Into this directory copy the webapps/axis directory from
  the xml-axis distribution. You can actually name this directory
  anything you want, just be aware that the name you choose will
  form the basis for the URL by which clients will access your
  service. The rest of this document assumes that the default
  webapp name, "axis" has been used; rename these references if
  appropriate. <A name="depend"></A></P>

  <H2>Step 2: Setting up the libraries</H2>

  <P>In the Axis directory, you will find a WEB-INF sub-directory.
  This directory contains some basic configuration information, but
  can also be used to contain the dependencies and web services you
  wish to deploy.</P>

  <P>Axis needs to be able to find an XML parser. If your
  application server or Java runtime does not make one visible to
  web applications, you need to download and add it. Java 1.4
  includes the Crimson parser, so you <I>can</I> omit this stage,
  though the Axis team prefer Xerces.</P>

  <P>To add an XML parser, acquire the JAXP 1.1 XML compliant
  parser of your choice. We recommend Xerces jars from the <A href=
  "http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-j/">xml-xerces
  distribution</A>, though others mostly work. Unless your JRE or
  app server has its own specific requirements, you can add the
  parser's libraries to axis/WEB-INF/lib.&nbsp; The examples in
  this guide use Xerces.&nbsp; This guide adds xml-apis.jar and
  xercesImpl.jar to the AXISCLASSPATH so that Axis can find the
  parser (<A href="#Classpath_setup">see below</A>).</P>

  <P>If you get ClassNotFound errors relating to Xerces or DOM then
  you do not have an XML parser installed, or your CLASSPATH (or
  AXISCLASSPATH) variables are not correctly configured.</P>

  <H3>Tomcat 4.x and Java 1.4</H3>

  <P>Java 1.4 changed the rules as to to how packages beginning in
  java.* and javax.* get loaded. Specifically, they only get loaded
  from <I>endorsed</I> directories. jaxrpc.jar and saaj.jar contain
  javax packages, so they may not get picked up. If happyaxis.jsp
  (see below) cannot find the relevant packages, copy them from
  axis/WEB-INF/lib to CATALINA_HOME/common/lib and restart Tomcat.
  <A name="start"></A></P>

  <H2>Step 3: starting the web server</H2>

  <P>This varies on a product-by-product basis. In many cases it is
  as simple as double clicking on a startup icon or running a
  command from the command line.</P>

  <P><A name="install-test"></A></P>

  <H2>Step 4: Validate the Installation</H2>

  <P>After installing the web application and dependencies, you
  should make sure that the server is running the web
  application.</P>

  <H3>Look for the start page</H3>

  <P>Navigate to the start page of the webapp, usually <A href=
  "http://127.0.0.1:8080/axis/">http://127.0.0.1:8080/axis/</A>,
  though of course the port may differ.<BR>
  <BR>
  You should now see an Apache-Axis start page. If you do not, then
  the webapp is not actually installed, or the appserver is not
  running.</P>

  <H3>Validate Axis with happyaxis</H3>

  <P>Follow the link <I>Validate the local installation's
  configuration</I><BR>
  This will bring you to <I>happyaxis.jsp</I> a test page that
  verifies that needed and optional libraries are present. The URL
  for this will be something like <A href=
  "http://localhost:8080/axis/happyaxis.jsp">http://localhost:8080/axis/happyaxis.jsp</A></P>

  <P>If any of the needed libraries are missing, Axis will not
  work.<BR>
  <B>You must not proceed until all needed libraries can be found,
  and this validation page is happy.</B><BR>
  Optional components are optional; install them as your need
  arises. If you see nothing but an internal server error and an
  exception trace, then you probably have multiple XML parsers on
  the CLASSPATH (or AXISCLASSPATH), and this is causing version
  confusion. Eliminate the extra parsers, restart the app server
  and try again.</P>

  <H3>Look for some services</H3>

  <P>From the start page, select <I>View the list of deployed Web
  services</I>. This will list all registered Web Services, unless
  the servlet is configured not to do so. On this page, You should
  be able to click on <I>(wsdl)</I> for each deployed Web service
  to make sure that your web service is up and running.</P>

  <P>Note that the 'instant' JWS Web Services that Axis supports
  are not listed in this listing here.&nbsp; The install guide
  covers this topic in detail.</P>

  <H3>Test a SOAP Endpoint</H3>

  <P>Now it's time to test a service. Although SOAP 1.1 uses HTTP
  POST to submit an XML request to the <I>endpoint</I>, Axis also
  supports a crude HTTP GET access mechanism, which is useful for
  testing. First let's retrieve the version of Axis from the
  version endpoint, calling the <CODE>getVersion</CODE> method:<BR>
  <BR>
  <A href=
  "http://localhost:8080/axis/services/Version?method=getVersion">http://localhost:8080/axis/services/Version?method=getVersion</A><BR>

  <BR>
  This should return something like:</P>
  <PRE class="xml">
  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?&gt; <BR>
  &lt;soapenv:Envelope <BR>
      xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" <BR>
      xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" <BR>
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"&gt;<BR>
      &lt;soapenv:Body&gt;<BR>
      &lt;getVersionResponse <BR>
          soapenv:encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/"&gt;<BR>
          &lt;getVersionReturn <BR>
              xsi:type="xsd:string"&gt;<BR>
              Apache Axis version: 1.1 Built on Apr 04, 2003 (01:30:37 PST)<BR>
          &lt;/getVersionReturn&gt; <BR>
      &lt;/getVersionResponse&gt;<BR>
      &lt;/soapenv:Body&gt;<BR>
  &lt;/soapenv:Envelope&gt;
</PRE>

  <P>The Axis version and build date may of course be
  different.</P>

  <H3>Test a JWS Endpoint</H3>

  <P>Now let's test a JWS web service. Axis' JWS Web Services are
  java files you save into the Axis webapp <I>anywhere but the
  WEB-INF tree</I>, giving them the .jws extension. When someone
  requests the .jws file by giving its URL, it is compiled and
  executed. The user guide covers JWS pages in detail.</P>

  <P>To test the JWS service, we make a request against a built-in
  example, EchoHeaders.jws (look for this in the axis/
  directory).</P>

  <P>Point your browser at <A href=
  "http://localhost:8080/axis/EchoHeaders.jws?method=list">http://localhost:8080/axis/EchoHeaders.jws?method=list</A>
  .</P>

  <P>This should return an XML listing of your application headers,
  such as</P>
  <PRE class="xml">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?&gt; <BR>
&lt;soapenv:Envelope <BR>
    xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" <BR>
    xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" <BR>
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"&gt;<BR>
    &lt;soapenv:Body&gt;<BR>
        &lt;listResponse <BR>
            soapenv:encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/"&gt;<BR>
            &lt;listReturn xsi:type="soapenc:Array" <BR>
                soapenc:arrayType="xsd:string[6]" <BR>
                xmlns:soapenc="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/"&gt;<BR>
                &lt;item&gt;accept:image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, */*&lt;/item&gt; <BR>
                &lt;item&gt;accept-language:en-us&lt;/item&gt; <BR>
                &lt;item&gt;accept-encoding:gzip, deflate&lt;/item&gt; <BR>
                &lt;item&gt;user-agent:Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)&lt;/item&gt; <BR>
                &lt;item&gt;host:localhost:8080&lt;/item&gt; <BR>
                &lt;item&gt;connection:Keep-Alive&lt;/item&gt; <BR>
            &lt;/listReturn&gt;<BR>
        &lt;/listResponse&gt;<BR>
    &lt;/soapenv:Body&gt;<BR>
&lt;/soapenv:Envelope&gt;
</PRE><BR>

  <P>Again, the exact return values will be different, and you may
  need to change URLs to correct any host, port and webapp
  specifics. <A name="websvc"></A></P>

  <H2>Step 5: Installing new Web Services</H2>

  <P>So far you have got Axis installed and working--now it is time
  to add your own Web Service.</P>

  <P>The process here boils down to (1) get the classes and
  libraries of your new service into the Axis WAR directory tree,
  and (2) tell the AxisEngine about the new file. The latter is
  done by submitting an XML deployment descriptor to the service
  via the Admin web service, which is usually done with the
  AdminClient program or the &lt;axis-admin&gt; Ant task. Both of
  these do the same thing: they run the Axis SOAP client to talk to
  the Axis adminstration service, which is a SOAP service in its
  own right. It's also a special SOAP service in one regard--it is
  restricted to local callers only (not remote access) and is
  password protected to stop random people from administrating your
  service. There is a default password that the client knows; if
  you change it then you need to pass the new password to the
  client.</P>

  <P>The first step is to add your code to the server.</P>

  <P>In the WEB-INF directory, look for (or create) a "classes"
  directory (i.e. axis/WEB-INF/classes ). In this directory, copy
  the compiled Java classes you wish to install, being careful to
  preserve the directory structure of the Java packages.</P>

  <P>If your classes services are already packaged into JAR files,
  feel free to drop them into the WEB-INF/lib directory instead.
  Also add any third party libraries you depend on into the same
  directory.</P>

  <P>After adding new classes or libraries to the Axis webapp, you
  must restart the webapp. This can be done by restarting your
  application server, or by using a server-specific mechanism to
  restart a specific webapp.</P>

  <P><SPAN class="note">Note:</SPAN> If your web service uses the
  simple authorization handlers provided with xml-axis (this is
  actually <U>not</U> recommended as these are merely illustrations
  of how to write a handler than intended for production use), then
  you will need to copy the corresponding users.lst file into the
  WEB-INF directory.</P>

  <P><A name="deploy"></A></P>

  <H2>Step 6: Deploying your Web Service</H2>

  <P>The various classes and JARs you have just set up implement
  your new Web Service. What remains to be done is to tell Axis how
  to expose this web service. Axis takes a Web Service Deployment
  Descriptor (WSDD) file that describes in XML what the service is,
  what methods it exports and other aspects of the SOAP
  endpoint.</P>

  <P>The users guide and reference guide cover these WSDD files;
  here we are going to use one from the Axis samples: the stock
  quote service.</P>

  <H3><A name="Classpath_setup"></A>Classpath setup</H3>

  <P>In order for these examples to work, java must be able to find
  axis.jar, commons-discovery.jar, commons-logging.jar, jaxrpc.jar,
  saaj.jar, log4j-1.2.8.jar (or whatever is appropriate for your
  chosen logging implementation), and the XML parser jar file or
  files (e.g., xerces.jar).  These examples do this by adding these
  files to AXISCLASSPATH and then specifying the AXISCLASSPATH when
  you run them. Also for these examples, we have copied the
  xml-apis.jar and xercesImpl.jar files into the AXIS_LIB
  directory.  An alternative would be to add your XML parser's jar
  file directly to the AXISCLASSPATH variable or to add all these
  files to your CLASSPATH variable.<BR>
  <BR>
  On Windows, this can be done via the following. For this document
  we assume that you have installed Axis in C:\axis. To store this
  information permanently in WinNT/2000/XP you will need to right
  click on "My Computer" and select "Properties". Click the
  "Advanced" tab and create the new environmental variables.  It is
  often better to use WordPad to create the variable string and
  then paste it into the appropriate text field.</P>
  <PRE class="xml">
    set AXIS_HOME=c:\axis<BR>
    set AXIS_LIB=%AXIS_HOME%\lib<BR>
    set AXISCLASSPATH=%AXIS_LIB%\axis.jar;%AXIS_LIB%\commons-discovery.jar;<BR>
          %AXIS_LIB%\commons-logging.jar;%AXIS_LIB%\jaxrpc.jar;%AXIS_LIB%\saaj.jar;<BR>
          %AXIS_LIB%\log4j-1.2.8.jar;%AXIS_LIB%\xml-apis.jar;%AXIS_LIB%\xercesImpl.jar
</PRE>

  <P>Unix users have to do something similar. Below we have
  installed AXIS into /usr/axis and are using the bash shell. See
  your shell's documentation for differences. To make variables
  permenate you will need to add them to your shell's startup (dot)
  files. Again, see your shell's documentation.</P>
  <PRE class="xml">
    set AXIS_HOME=/usr/axis<BR>
    set AXIS_LIB=$AXIS_HOME/lib<BR>
    set AXISCLASSPATH=$AXIS_LIB/axis.jar:$AXIS_LIB/commons-discovery.jar:<BR>
          $AXIS_LIB/commons-logging.jar:$AXIS_LIB/jaxrpc.jar:$AXIS_LIB/saaj.jar:<BR>
          $AXIS_LIB/log4j-1.2.8.jar:$AXIS_LIB/xml-apis.jar:$AXIS_LIB/xercesImpl.jar<BR>
    export AXIS_HOME; export AXIS_LIB; export AXISCLASSPATH
</PRE>

  <P>To use Axis client code, you can select AXISCLASSPATH when
  invoking Java by entering</P>
  <PRE class="xml">
java -cp %AXISCLASSPATH% ...
</PRE>

  <P>or</P>
  <PRE class="xml">
java -cp "$AXISCLASSPATH" ...
</PRE>

  <P>depending on the platform. You may omit the quotes if your
  CLASSPATH doesn't have spaces in it.<BR>
  <BR>
  Also, it is probably a good time to add the AXISCLASSPATH
  variable to your CLASSPATH variable.  This will enable you to not
  include the AXISCLASSPATH variable when launching the examples in
  this guide.  This document assumes that you have NOT done
  this.</P>

  <H3>Find the deployment descriptor</H3>

  <P>Look in axis/samples/stock for the file deploy.wsdd. This is
  the deployment descriptor we want to tell Axis about. Deployment
  descriptors are an Axis-specific XML file that tells Axis how to
  deploy (or undeploy) a Web Service, and how to configure Axis
  itself. The Axis Administration Web Service lets the AdminClient
  program and its Ant task counterpart submit a new WSDD file for
  interpretation. The Axis 'engine' will update its configuration,
  then save its state.</P>

  <P>By default Axis saves it state into the global configuration
  file axis/WEB-INF/server-config.wsdd. Sometimes you see a warning
  message about such a file not being found--don't worry about
  this, because Axis auto-creates the file after you deploy
  something to it. You can check in the webapp to see what this
  file looks like--and even copy it to other systems if you want to
  give them identical configurations. Note that Axis needs an
  expanded web application <I>and</I> write access to the WEB-INF
  dir to save its state in this location.</P>

  <H3>Run the admin client</H3>

  <P>Execute the following command from the samples/stock
  directory.  If you are not in this directory you will get a
  "java.io.FileNotFoundException: deploy.wsdd (The system cannot
  find the file specified)" exception.</P>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <B>On Windows</B><BR>
    <CODE class="java">java -cp %AXISCLASSPATH%

  <P>If you get some java client error (like
  ClassNotFoundException), then you haven't set up your
  AXISCLASSPATH (or CLASSPATH) variable right, mistyped the
  classname, or did some other standard error. Tracking down such
  problems are foundational Java development skills--if you don't
  know how to do these things, learn them now!</P>

  <P><SPAN class="note">Note:</SPAN> You may need to replace
  localhost with your host name, and 8080 with the port number used
  by your web server. If you have renamed the web application to
  something other than "axis" change the URL appropriately.</P>

  <P>If you get some AxisFault listing, then the client is working,
  but the deployment was unsuccessful. This is where the knowledge
  of the sockets API to TCP and the basics of the HTTP that Web
  Service development requires begins to be needed. If you got some
  socket error like connection refused, the computer at the far end
  isn't talking to you, so find the cause of that and fix it. If
  you get an HTTP error code back find out what the error means and
  correct the problem.  These skills are fundamental to using web
  services.</P>

  <P>The <A href="user-guide.html">user's guide</A> covers the
  AdminClient in more detail, and there is also an <A href=
  "ant/axis-admin.html">Ant task</A> to automate the use of Axis in
  your Ant build scripts.</P>

  <P><A name="test"></A></P>

  <H2>Step 7: Testing</H2>

  <P>This step is optional, but highly recommended. For
  illustrative purposes, it is presumed that you have installed and
  deployed the stock quote demo.</P>

  <H2>Advanced Installation: adding Axis to your own Webapp</H2>

  <P>If you are experienced in web application development, and
  especially if you wish to add web services to an existing or
  complex webapp, you can take an alternate approach to running
  Axis. Instead of adding your classes to the Axis webapp, you can
  add Axis to your application.</P>

  <P>The core concepts are</P>

  <OL>
    <LI>Add axis.jar, wsdl.jar, saaj.jar, jaxrpc.jar and the other
    dependent libraries to your WAR file.</LI>

    <LI>Copy all the Axis Servlet declarations and mappings from
    axis/WEB-INF/web.xml and add them to your own web.xml</LI>

    <LI>Build and deploy your webapp.</LI>

    <LI>Run the Axis AdminClient against your own webapp, instead
    of Axis, by changing the URL you invoke it with.</LI>
  </OL>

  <P>The process is also covered in Chapter 15 of <A href=
  "http://manning.com/antbook">Java Development with Ant</A>, which
  can be downloaded as a <A href=
  "http://www.manning.com/hatcher/chap15.pdf">PDF file</A>.
  <A name="broken"></A></P>

  <H2>What if it doesn't work?</H2>

  <P>Axis is a complicated system to install. This is because it
  depends on the underlying functionality of your app server, has a
  fairly complex configuration, and, like all distributed
  applications, depends upon the network too.</P>

  <P>We see a lot of people posting their problems on the axis-user
  mailing list, and other Axis users as well as the Axis developers
  do their best to help when they can. But before you rush to post
  your own problems to the mailing list, a word of caution:</P>

  <P>Axis is free. This means nobody gets paid to man the support
  lines. All the help you get from the community is voluntary and
  comes from the kindness of their hearts. They may be other users,
  willing to help you get past the same hurdles they had to be
  helped over, or they may be the developers themselves. But it is
  all voluntary, so you may need to keep your expectations low!</P>

  <OL>
    <LI>Post to the <A href="mailto:axis-user@ws.apache.org">user
    mail</A> list, not the developer list. You may think the
    developer mail list is a short cut to higher quality answers.
    But the developers are also on the user list along with many
    other skilled users--so more people will be able to answer your
    questions. Also, it is helpful for all user issues to be on one
    list to help build the searchable mailing list archive.</LI>

    <LI>Don't ask non-Axis-related questions. The list is not the
    place to ask about non-Axis, non-SOAP, problems. Even questions
    about the MS Soap toolkit or .NET client side, don't get many
    positive answers--we avoid them. That also goes for the Sun
    Java Web Services Developer Pack, or the Jboss.net stuff that
    they've done with Axis.</LI>

    <LI>Never bother posting to the soapbuilders mailing list
    either, that is only for people developing SOAP toolkits, not
    using them--all off-topic messages are pointedly ignored.</LI>

    <LI>There is no guarantee that anyone will be able to solve
    your problem. The usual response in such a situation is
    silence, for a good reason: if everybody who didn't know the
    answer to a question said "I don't know", the list would be
    overflowed with noise. Don't take silence personally.</LI>

    <LI>Never expect an immediate answer. Even if someone knows the
    answer, it can take a day or two before they read their mail.
    So if you don't get an answer in an hour or two, don't panic
    and resend. Be patient. And put the time to use by trying to
    solve your problems yourself.</LI>

    <LI>Do your homework first. This document lists the
    foundational stuff you need to understand. It has also warned
    you that it can take a day to get a reply. Now imagine you get
    a HTTP Error '404' on a SOAP call. Should you rush to post a
    'help' request, or should you try and find out what an HTTP
    error code is, what #404 usually means and how to use a Java
    debugger. We provide the source to make that debugging easier
    :)</LI>

    <LI>Post meaningful subject lines. You want your message read,
    not deleted unread. A subject line of 'Axis problem', 'Help
    with Axis', etc. is not meaningful, and is not likely to get
    many readers.</LI>

    <LI>Search the <A href=
    "http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/SummarizeList?listId=49">mailing
    list archives</A> FIRST to see if someone had the same problem.
    This list is searchable--and may save you much time in getting
    an answer to your problem.</LI>

    <LI>Use the <A href=
    "http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/">bugzilla</A> database to
    search for Axis bugs, both open and closed.</LI>

    <LI>Consult the <A href=
    "http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?AxisProjectPages">
    Axis Wiki</A> For its Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ),
    installation notes, interoperability issues lists, and other
    useful information.</LI>

    <LI>Don't email people for help directly, unless you know them.
    It's rude and presumptious. Messages sent over the mail list
    benefit the whole community--both the original posters and
    people who search the list. Personal messages just take up the
    recipients time, and are unwelcome. Usually, if not ignored
    outright, recipients of personal requests will just respond
    'ask the mail list' anyway!</LI>

    <LI>Know that configuration problems are hard to replicate, and
    so can be difficult to get help on. We have tried with the
    happyaxis.jsp demo to automate the diagnostics gathering for
    you, but it can be hard for people to be of help here,
    especially for obscure platforms.</LI>

    <LI>Keep up to date with Axis releases, even the beta copies of
    forthcoming releases. You wouldn't want your problem to be a
    bug that was already known and fixed in a more recent release.
    Often the common response to any question is 'have you tried
    the latest release'.</LI>

    <LI>Study and use the source, and fix it when you find defects.
    Even fix the documentation when you find defects. It is only
    through the participation of Axis' users that it will ever get
    better.</LI>
  </OL>

  <P>Has this put you off joining and participating in the Axis
  user mail list? We hope not--this list belongs to the people who
  use Axis and so will be your peers as your project proceeds. We
  just need for you to be aware that it is not a 24x7 support line
  for people new to server side Java development, and that you will
  need to be somewhat self sufficient in this regard. It is not a
  silver bullet. However, knowing how to make effective use of the
  list will help you develop better with Axis. <A name=
  "summary"></A></P>

  <H2>Summary</H2>

  <P>Axis is simply an implementation of SOAP which can be added to
  your own webapp, and a webapp which can host your own web
  services. Installing it can be a bit fiddly, especially given
  Java 1.4's stricter requirements. If you follow a methodical
  process, including testing along the way, using happyaxis and the
  bundled test services, you will find it easier to get started
  with Axis.</P>
