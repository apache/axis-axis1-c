  <P>Greetings, intrepid tester/developer/reader!</P>

  <P>This file exists to keep track of various tests which someone
  needs to write for Axis at some point. Ideally, any time you
  write a piece of code in Axis, you should also write
  <B>documentation</B> and <B>tests</B> for whatever functionality
  you work on. Unfortunately, we live in the real world and that
  doesn't always happen. Hence, this file.</P>

  <P>This is a place to keep track, in simple english descriptions,
  of particular tests which need to be written. It serves two main
  purposes : 1) to help us remember these things, and 2) to provide
  a starting point for development when people have some spare
  cycles or are interested in finding some way to participate in
  the Axis community.</P>

  <P>On to the (soon-to-be) tests:</P>
