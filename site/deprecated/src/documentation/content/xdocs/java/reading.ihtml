    with JAX-RPC and Apache Axis.</A><BR>
    by Pankaj Kumar. Starting with a 10000 ft. view of Web
    Services, prior technologies, current and emerging standards,
    it quickly gets into the nitty-gritties of using JAX-RPC and
    Apache Axis for writing and executing programs. Has a nice
    coverage of different invocation styles - generated stubs,
    dynamic proxy and dynamic invocation interface. A good place to
    start if you are new to Web Services and Axis.<BR>

    the deployment problem, advocating a fully automated deployment
    process in which configuration problems are treated as defects
    for which automated test cases and regresssion testing are
    appropriate. Happyaxis.jsp is the canonical example of this.

    An introductory book, with the early chapters focusing on

    The <A href=

    sample chapter</A> shows how to install Axis with Tomcat 4.0:
    we do not believe that their approach is the best. It is easier
    to drop jaxrpc.jar and saaj.jar into the
    CATALINA_HOME/common/lib dir than it is to add all axis jars to

    The first nothing-but-Axis book.<BR>
    It is based on Beta-1. This is a reasonable book, despite is
    apparent thinness and relative age. If it has a major weakness
    it believes everything works as intended, which regular Axis
    users will know is not quite true yet. Maybe they didn't want
    to fault missing features and other gotchas, assuming they
    would be fixed by the time the product shipped, but the
    effective result is that you can get into minor trouble working
    from this book, trying to use bits that aren't there, or just
    don't work (yet).</LI>
