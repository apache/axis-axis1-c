    by Pankaj Kumar. Starting with a 10000 ft. view of Web
    Services, prior technologies, current and emerging standards,
    it quickly gets into the nitty-gritties of using JAX-RPC and
    Apache Axis for writing and executing programs. Has a nice
    coverage of different invocation styles - generated stubs,
    dynamic proxy and dynamic invocation interface. A good place to
    start if you are new to Web Services and Axis.<BR>

    process in which configuration problems are treated as defects
    for which automated test cases and regresssion testing are
    appropriate. Happyaxis.jsp is the canonical example of this.

    The <A href=

    The first nothing-but-Axis book.<BR>
    It is based on Beta-1. This is a reasonable book, despite is
    apparent thinness and relative age. If it has a major weakness
    it believes everything works as intended, which regular Axis
    users will know is not quite true yet. Maybe they didn't want
    to fault missing features and other gotchas, assuming they
    would be fixed by the time the product shipped, but the
    effective result is that you can get into minor trouble working
    from this book, trying to use bits that aren't there, or just
    don't work (yet).</LI>
