      <title>WebServices - Axis - Overview</title>

<p>
Every volunteer project obtains its strength from the people involved in it. 
We invite you to participate as much or as little as you choose. The roles 
and responsibilities that people can assume in the project are based on 
merit. Everybody's input matters!
</p>
<p>
There are a variety of ways to participate. Regardless of how you choose 
to participate, we suggest you join some or all of our 
<link href="mail.html">mailing lists</link>. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Use the Products and Give Us Feedback</b>
</p>
<p>
Using the products,reporting bugs, making feature requests, etc. is by 
far the most important role. It's your feedback that allows the technology 
to evolve.

</ul>

<b>Contribute Code or Documentation Patches</b>

is the type of role you'd like to play, here are some steps (in addition to 
the ones above) to get you started:
