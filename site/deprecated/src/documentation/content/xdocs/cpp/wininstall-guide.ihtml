<h1>What binary distribution contains</h1>
<p>
1. There is a folder called &quot;binary&quot;.<br>
<br>

<h1>Installation with Apache 1.3.27 web server</h1>
<p>STEPS:</p>


<p>1. Install apache 1.3.27 and locate the installation folder(folder where Apache.exe is). 
   Let say this folder to be APACHE_FOLDER.
</p>
<p>2. Unzip axis-c-alpha-win32.zip to a folder of your choice. Say this folder AXIS_EXTRACT.
</p>
<p>3. Inside the extracted folder AXIS_EXTRACT you have a sub folder called deploy. Copy 
   whole deploy folder to APACHE_FOLDER.
</p>
<p>4. Rename copied "deploy" folder to "Axis". Lets say this folder to be AXIS_FOLDER. 
</p>
<p>5. Set environment variable AXIS_HOME to point to above folder.
</p>
<p>6. Add AXIS_FOLDER/libs to the PATH environment variable.
</p>
<p>7. Edit Apache configuration file httpd.conf located in APACHE_FOLDER/conf and add following 
   lines at the end. <br>
<br>
LoadModule axis_module modules/mod_axis.dll<br>
&lt;Location /axis&gt;<br>
SetHandler axis<br>
&lt;/Location&gt;<br>
<br>
8. Copy mod_axis.dll from the AXIS_EXTRACT/bin folder to APACHE_FOLDER/modules folder.
</p>
<p>9. Restart apache web server. If you have done correctly apache server should start without 
   giving any error.
</p>
<p>10. Open a internet browser and check http://localhost/axis. If you get the Axis C++ welcome 
   page you are done.

<h1>Installation with Simple Axis Server</h1>
<p>
<b>(For the Alpha release we recommend installing Axis with the Apache web 
server. The simple Axis Server is still under development and presented here for 
testing purposes.)</b></p>
<br>

<p>STEPS:</p>


<p>1. Create a folder of your choice. We will call this folder as SIMPLE_AXIS_SERVER_FOLDER.
</p>
<p>2. Unzip axis-c-alpha-win32.zip to a folder of your choice. Say this folder AXIS_EXTRACT.
</p>
<p>3. Inside the extracted folder AXIS_EXTRACT you have a sub folder called deploy. Copy 
   whole deploy folder to SIMPLE_AXIS_SERVER_FOLDER.
</p>
<p>4. Rename copied "deploy" folder to "Axis". Lets say this folder to be AXIS_FOLDER. 
</p>
<p>5. Set environment variable AXIS_HOME to point to above folder.
</p>
<p>6. Copy the exe SimpleAxisServer.exe from AXIS_EXTRACT/bin to the SIMPLE_AXIS_SERVER_FOLDER.
</p>
<p>7. Copy the content of AXIS_FOLDER/libs to the SIMPLE_AXIS_SERVER_FOLDER.
</p>
<p>8. Start the SimpleAxisServer by providing the port to which operate. (eg: c:\SimpleAxisServer>SimpleAxisServer 80)

<p><a name="samples"></a></p>
</p>
<h1>Running provided samples</h1>
<p>
If Axis installation is a complete success, following sample web services and handlers have 
already been installed successfully.
</p>	
<p>1. InteropBase service</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. InteropGroupB service
</p>
<p>You can run the provided client programs to confirm whether they are working fine. The two
corresponding client applications are located in your AXIS_EXTRACT/bin as base.exe and groupB.exe.
to run this sample client applications you need to have the xerces-c_2_2_0.dll in the DLLPATH or 
current folder.

Note: These sample clients are compiled with assumption that server is running at localhost 
port 80.

</p>
<h1>Using Visual C++ to play with provided samples.</h1>
<p>
In your  AXIS_EXTRACT/samples folder you have the samples. If you are using Visual C++ you can 
open the workspace file AXIS_EXTRACT/samples/projects/vc6/interoptests/interoptests.dsw. There
are four projects in the workspace. Out of them "base" and "GroupB" are client applications and other two are web services.
