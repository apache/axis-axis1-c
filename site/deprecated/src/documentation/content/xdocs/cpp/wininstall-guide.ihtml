<p>1. There is a folder called "binary".<br>
<br>

-&gt; lib<br>
-&gt; samples<br>
<br>
3. The folder "bin" contains following executables and dll's<br>
Executables<br>
-&gt; AdminClient.exe (soap client to Deploy or Undeploy a web service)<br>

5. The "include" folder contains all the include files which are necessary
for this binary to work.<br>
6. "lib" folder contains all the lib files for xercess-c and axisjava.<br>
7. "samples" folder contains all the server and client samples for interop
tests.</p>

<h1>Installation with Apache 1.3.X/2.X web server</h1>

<p>STEPS:</p>

<p>1. Install apache web server and locate the installation folder(For the
defalt installation this is "C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache" for apache
1.3.X and "C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2" for apache 2.X). Let say
this folder to be APACHE_FOLDER.</p>

<p>2. Unzip axis-c-alpha-win32.zip to a folder of your choice. Say this
folder AXIS_EXTRACT.</p>

<p>3. Inside the extracted folder AXIS_EXTRACT you have a sub folder called
deploy. Copy whole deploy folder to APACHE_FOLDER.</p>

<p>4. Rename copied "deploy" folder to "Axis". Lets say this folder to be
AXIS_FOLDER.</p>

<p>5. Set environment variable AXIS_HOME to point to above folder.</p>

<p>6. Add AXIS_FOLDER/libs to the PATH environment variable.</p>

<p>7. Edit Apache configuration file httpd.conf located in APACHE_FOLDER/conf
and add following lines at the end. <br>
<br>
LoadModule axis_module modules/AXISMODULE<br>
&lt;Location /axis&gt;<br>
SetHandler axis<br>
&lt;/Location&gt;<br>
<br>
Where AXISMODULE is either mod_axis.dll for apache 1.3.X or mod_axis2.dll for
apache 2.X.<br>
<br>
8. Copy AXISMODULEfrom the AXIS_EXTRACT/bin folder to APACHE_FOLDER/modules
folder.</p>

<p>9. Restart apache web server. If you have done correctly apache server
should start without giving any error.<br>
<br>
<b>apache 1.3.X :</b></p>

<p>It is recommended that apache 1.3.X be started as "apache -k start" on the
command line</p>

<p><b>apache 2.X :</b></p>

<p>While testing the apache 2 module a problem was noted with the apache 2
web server, in that the webserver takes up about 98% of CPU time and the
server does not even serve the startup page. The workaround for this is to
start the apache web server as "apache -X" to make it run single threaded.
While this is sufficient to test the apache 2 module this problem needs to be
investigated further.</p>

<p>10. Open a internet browser and check http://localhost/axis. If the module
has loaded properly then you should get the axis welcome page with a listing
of deployed web services.</p>

<h1>Installation with Simple Axis Server</h1>

<p><b>(For the Alpha release we recommend installing Axis with the Apache web
server. The simple Axis Server is still under development and presented here
for testing purposes.)</b></p>
<br>


<p>STEPS:</p>

<p>1. Create a folder of your choice. We will call this folder as
SIMPLE_AXIS_SERVER_FOLDER.</p>

<p>2. Unzip axis-c-alpha-win32.zip to a folder of your choice. Say this
folder AXIS_EXTRACT.</p>

<p>3. Inside the extracted folder AXIS_EXTRACT you have a sub folder called
deploy. Copy whole deploy folder to SIMPLE_AXIS_SERVER_FOLDER.</p>

<p>4. Rename copied "deploy" folder to "Axis". Lets say this folder to be
AXIS_FOLDER.</p>

<p>5. Set environment variable AXIS_HOME to point to above folder.</p>

<p>6. Copy the exe SimpleAxisServer.exe from AXIS_EXTRACT/bin to the
SIMPLE_AXIS_SERVER_FOLDER.</p>

<p>7. Copy the content of AXIS_FOLDER/libs to the
SIMPLE_AXIS_SERVER_FOLDER.</p>

<p>8. Start the SimpleAxisServer by providing the port to which operate. (eg:
c:\SimpleAxisServer&gt;SimpleAxisServer 80)</p>

<p><a name="samples"></a></p>

<h1>Running provided samples</h1>

<p>If Axis installation is a complete success, following sample web services
and handlers have already been installed successfully.</p>

<p>1. InteropBase service</p>

<p>&nbsp;2. InteropGroupB service </p>

<p>You can run the provided client programs to confirm whether they are
working fine. The two corresponding client applications are located in your
AXIS_EXTRACT/bin as base.exe and groupB.exe. To run this sample client
applications you need to have the path to xerces-c_2_2_0.dll in the "DLLPATH"
environment variable or xerces-c_2_2_0.dll should be placed where the
apache.exe is. Note: These sample clients are compiled with assumption that
server is running at localhost port 80.</p>

<p><a name="playsamples"></a></p>

<h1>Using Visual C++ to play with provided samples.</h1>

<p>In your  AXIS_EXTRACT/samples folder you have the samples. If you are
using Visual C++ you can open the workspace file
AXIS_EXTRACT/samples/projects/vc6/interoptests/interoptests.dsw. There are
four projects in the workspace. Out of them "base" and "GroupB" are client
applications and other two are web services.</p>
