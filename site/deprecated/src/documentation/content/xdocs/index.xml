<hr/>
<p>Apache Axis is an implementation of the SOAP ("Simple Object Access
Protocol") <link href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP" target="_top">submission</link>
to W3C.
</p>
<p>From the draft W3C specification:
<blockquote>SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchange of information
in a decentralized, distributed environment. It is an XML based protocol
that consists of three parts: an envelope that defines a framework for
describing what is in a message and how to process it, a set of encoding
rules for expressing instances of application-defined datatypes, and a
convention for representing remote procedure calls and responses.</blockquote>

<p>
This project is a follow-on to the <link href="http://ws.apache.org/soap">Apache SOAP project</link>.

<p>
Axis 1.1 has proven itself to be a reliable and stable base on which to
implement Java Web Services.  There is a very active 
<link href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/mail.html">user community</link>
 and there a many companies who use Axis for Web Service
support in their products.
</p>
<p>
For Axis 1.2, we are focusing on our document/literal support to better address the 
<link href="http://www.ws-i.org/Profiles/Basic/2003-08/BasicProfile-1.0a.html">WS-I Basic Profile 1.0</link>

And we are fixing as many bug as possible.
