<h3>Introduction</h3>
</div>
<p>This guide will help you to start with Axis C++. I'll explain the minimum steps needed to build and run Axis C++, and warn you about the common pitfalls.</p>
<p>

<h3>What You Need</h3>
</div>
<p>You need few helper libraries  for logging, WSDL processing and introspection. You need to have the following in order to run Axis C++ engine.</p>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp RedHat 9 (2.4.20-8) <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp expat-1.95.7 (source) <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp xerces-c-src2_2_0 (I build xerces from source) <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp httpd-2.0.48 (source)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp apache_1.3.27 (source) <p>

<p><b>Note: In my environment I have </b> <br> 
autoconf 2.57 <br> 
automake 1.6.3 <br>
libtool 1.4.3 <br> 
gcc 3.2.2</b></p>
<p> You can download the Axis C++ source or binary from one of the apache mirror sites <br>
    <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/cpp/download.html">http://ws.apache.org/axis/cpp/download.html</a><br> <br>
You can get expat from the uri <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/</a><br> <br>

You can get xercesc from the uri <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/download.cgi">http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/download.cgi</a><br> <br>

You must define some environment variables in order to build. <br>
AXISCPP_HOME is where you checkout Axis C++</p>
<br>
<p><b>AXISCPP_HOME="/usr/local/axiscpp"</b><br>
<b>AXISCPP_DEPLOY="/usr/local/axiscpp_deploy"</b><br>
<b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$AXISCPP_DEPLOY/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"</b><br>
<b>export AXISCPP_HOME AXISCPP_DEPLOY LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b><br> </p>

<p>Axis C++ core is independant of the parser layer and transport layer.</p>
<p>You can write your own transport or parser library according to the APIs provided. Currently Axis C++ provides API implementations for Xerces-c and Expat. It also provides it's own client side transport library implementation. In the server side deployment, Axis C++ provides two modules that can be loaded into apache1.3 and apache 2 as shared libraries.</p>
<p>So this sums upto two possibilities.<br>
You can deploy Axis C++ server <br>
&nbsp &nbsp On Apache2 with xercesc parser or expat parser(Only one parser at a time)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp On Apache1.3 with xercesc parser or expat parser<br>
</p>

<p><b>When you build Axis C++ you can give options</b></p>
<p><b>1) Build for Apache2</b><br>
   With Expat parser support only<br>
   With Xerces parser support only<br>
   With both parser support</p>
<p><b>2) Build for Apache1.3</b><br>
   With Expat parser support only<br>
   With Xerces parser support only<br>
   With both parser support</p>
<p>You can choose these selections when you configure</p>

<br>

<p> <b>The build process</b> </p>
<p> <b>cd $AXISCPP_HOME</b></p>
<p> <b>sh autogen.sh </b> <br> <br>
<b>./configure --prefix=<Where you need to deploy axis c++> \</b><br>
<b>--with-apache2=<path to apache2> \</b> <br>
<b> --with-expat=/usr/local/expat1957</b> <br>
<br>
<b>make</b> <br>
<b>make install</b> </p>

<p>This will deploy Axis C++ into your folder of choice.<br>
Following are some of the options available with configure <br> <br>
<b>--with-apache2 : </b>To use apache2 as server transport library <br> <br>
<b>--with-apache : </b>To use apache as server transport library<br> <br>
<b>--with-expat : </b>To build expat parser library <br> <br>
<b>--with-xercesc :</b>To build xercesc parser library<br> <br>
<b>--enable-samples : </b>Whether you need to build samples(server and client)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp By default samples are built. If you don't want to build
                   the samples then you need to specifically say no <br> <br>
<b>--enable-testcases : </b>Whether you need to build testcases <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp By default test cases are built. If you don't want to build the test cases then you need to specifically say no <br> <br>
<b>--enable-log : </b>Whether to enable log facility. By dafault this is enabled. If you don't need it say no to this <br> <br>
<b>--enable-libwww : </b>By default libwww client transport library  is built. If you don't need it say no to this. <br> </p>

<p> You may rename and edit build.sh_sample for one step building and installing.</p>
<p>Once you have finished , have a look at <b>$AXISCPP_HOME/build_errors.</b> Most probably you will see many warnings.
Just ignore them. But if you see any errors it means that build was not successful and check whether you have followed the instructions 
carefully. </p>
<p>You can see the folder <b>$AXISCPP_DEPLOY/lib </b>to see what are created</p>

<p> <b>libaxiscpp_mod.so is apache module which is loaded when apache loads <br>
libaxiscpp_mod2.so is apache2 module which is loaded when apache2 loads <br>
libserver_engine.so is the Axis C++ server engine which is loaded by libaxis_mod(2).so module <br>
libaxiscpp_client.so is Axis C++ client library <br>
libaxis_transport.so is the Axis C++ client transport library <br>
libaxis_expat.so is the expat parser library implementation for Axis C++ <br>
libaxis_xercesc.so is the xercesc parser library implmentation for Axis C++ </b> </p>

<p>Also $AXISCPP_HOME/samples/server samples are built and installed in $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/lib </p>

<p>$AXISCPP_HOME/samples/client samples are built and executables are in $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/bin </p>

<p>Now you need to add to <b>$&lt;apache install directory&gt/conf/httpd.conf <br>
$ vi &lt;apache install directory&gt/conf/httpd.conf </b> </p>
<br>
<p>At the bottom of the file you have to include following lines and save it.</p>
<p><b>LoadModule axis_module modules/libaxiscpp_mod2.so</b> (in apache1.3 replace modules with libexec and libaxiscpp_mod2.so with libaxiscpp_mod.so)<br> 
<b>&lt;Location /axis&gt;</b><br>
<b>SetHandler axis</b><br>
<b>&lt;/Location&gt;</b></p>

<p>Now you need the deployment descripter (server.wsdd) to deploy server samples you built.</p>
<p>By default there is a deployment descripter in $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/conf to deploy samples </p>
 
<p>In $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/etc/axiscpp.conf file you can give paths to your log files, configuration files libraries etc. </p>

<br>

<p><p><b># The comment character is '#'</b><br>
<b>#Available directives are as follows</b><br>
<b>#(Some of these directives may not be implemented yet)</b><br>
<b>#</b><br>
<b>#WSDDFilePath:The path to the server wsdd</b><br>
<b>#LogPath:The path to the axis log</b><br>
<b>#ClientLogPath:The path to the axis client log</b><br>
<b>#ClientWSDDFilePath:The path to the client wsdd</b><br>
<b>#Transport_http:The HTTP transport library</b><br>
<b>#Transport_smtp:The SMTP transport library</b><br>
<b>#XMLParser:The xml parser library</b></p>

<p><b>LogPath:/usr/local/axiscpp_deploy/log/AxisLog</b><br>
<b>WSDDFilePath:/usr/local/axiscpp_deploy/etc/server.wsdd</b><br>
<b>ClientLogPath:/usr/local/axiscpp_deploy/log/AxisClientLog</b><br>
<b>XMLParser:/usr/local/axiscpp_deploy/lib/libaxis_xmlparser.so</b><br>
<b>Transport_http:/usr/local/axiscpp_deploy/lib/libaxis_transport.so</b></p>

<br>

<p>Now we need to copy apache module(libaxiscpp_mod2.so for apache2 and libaxiscpp_mod.so for apache)
to the correct places and start apache.<br>
To do that you can find scripts written in $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/bin. <br>
<b>cd $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/bin</b> </p>

<p>To deploy on apache2<br>
<b>sh deploy_apache2.sh</b></p>

<p>To deploy on apache<br>
<b>sh deploy_apache.sh</b></p>

<p>When you run the above script, <br>
libaxiscpp_mod2.so is copied to &lt;your apache home&gt/modules folder. <br>
libaxis_expat.so is renamed to libaxis_xmlparser.so. Also apache is started and libaxiscpp_mod2.so is loaded into apache. <br>
libaxiscpp_mod2.so is the apache module for Axis C++. This will in term load Axis C++ server engine
(libserver_engine.so). <br>
Note that libaxis_xmlparser.so is loaded by the engine dynamically as parsing is required from the engine. </p>

<p>Note that somewhere in the script above, it changes the name libaxis_expat.so to libaxis_xmlparser.so. <br>
If we use xerces we need to change libaxis_xercesc.so to libaxis_xmlparser.so. </p>

<p>If you have done installation successfully it will display the Axis C++ welcome page when you point to URI <a href="http://localhost/axis">http://localhost/axis</a> <br> <br>
<b>Note: </b> In the axis welcome page all the services in $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/conf/server.wsdd are listed. This does not mean
that the libraries corresponding to these services are deployed yet. It merely list whatever in the server.wsdd.</p>

<br>
<p>To run interop samples <br>
<b>cd $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/bin </b> <br>
<b>./base localhost 80 etc.</b> </p>

<p>(Check whether there is a script run_interoptests.sh in that folder which can be used to run all the interop tests) </p>

<p> If you don't get it right check with the following list <br> <br>
Check whether AXISCPP_HOME is set where you build axis c++ by <br>
<b>  echo $AXISCPP_HOME </b> <br> <br>
Check whether AXISCPP_DEPLOY and LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set where you start apache <br>
 Build axis c++ and run clients by <br>
<b>echo $AXISCPP_DEPLOY <br>
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH </b> <br> <br>
</p>

<p>Check whether you have necessary permissions to create the deploy folder which you give in configure option prefix. <br>
eg: configure --prefix=/usr/local/axiscpp_deploy you need permission to write in   /usr/local/  </p>

<p>Check whether  paths in server.wsdd are pointing correctly to service or handler libraries <br> <br>

Check whether axiscpp.conf is containing correct entries <br> <br>

Check whether Axis C++  can write to log folder($AXISCPP_DEPLOY/log) </p>
