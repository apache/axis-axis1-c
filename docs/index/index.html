<h1>Key features of Axis C++ 1.4 Alpha </h1> </p>
<p><b>SSL Implementation</b> </p> <br> <br>
<p><b>Cookie based session support for the client side.</b> <br> <br>
Client is capable of tracking 'Set-Cookie' HTTP header sent with the service response and set the 'Cookie' HTTP header in the outgoing requests accordingly. </p> <br> <br>
<p><b>SOAP header based session support for the client side.</b> <br> <br>
This enables an Axis c++ client to have a session conversation with a session scoped Axis java Web Service. 
</p> <br> 
<h1>The Improvements</h1>
<p> <b>Axis Engine is pure C++</b> <br> 
<li>Changed mallocs/frees/strdups to news/deletes </li><br>
<li>.h header files were changed to .hpp</li> <br>
<li>structs were changed to classes</li> <br> <br> </p>
<p><b>Refactor WSDL2WS </b> <br>
<li>Corrected the issue with classpath ordering - order is no longer important</li> <br>
<li>Identified and removed unused classes </li> <br>
<li> identified and removed all duplicate classes. </li> <br>
<li>Re-organized class inheritance and removed all duplicated methods. </li> <br>
<li>Decomposed some of the larger methods into smaller, more manageable methods. </li> <br>
<li>Removed all compilation warnings </li> <br>
<li>Improved readability of code </li> <br>
<li>Corrected spelling mistakes in class names and methods</li> <br> <br> </p>
<p><b>Split client, server common includes </b> <br> <br>
The common header files have now been moved to include/axis <br> <br> </p>
<p><b>Pre-defined paths were removed from Axis CPP Conf library names</b> <br> <br>
Fully-qualified paths were  removed, leaving only the library name. <br> <br> </p>
<p><b>Eliminated warnings </b> <br> <br> </p>
<p><b>Handler Tutorial </b> <br> <br>
Handlers are plugable components of Axis C++. This guide gives you details of creating your own handlers.  <br> <br> </p>
<p><b>Provided access to the body of the SOAP message </b><br> <br>
Handler writers can get access to the SOAP Body.
<br> <br></p>
<p><b>Resolved the conflict in const/non-const method calls for Basic Node objects</b> <br> <br>
 <br> <br> </p>
<p><b>Added support to store Complex Object properties</b> <br> <br>
Added support to store complex objects in MessageData.
<br> <br> </p>
<p><b>Added the facility to set a new SOAP body to the DeSerializer from a Handler</b> <br><br>
Once a Handler gets access to the SOAP body it is the duty of the Handler to reset the new SOAP body through the SoapDeSerializer's "setNewSoapBody" method. <br> <br> </p>
<p>Added a transport that supports IPV6. <br> <br> </p> 
<br>
