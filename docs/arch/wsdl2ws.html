<h3>Dependencies on Axis Java tool</h3>

<p>The document below describes the areas where Apache Axis C++ is dependant upon the Axis Java tool. </p>
<p>The Axis jars given below are used as they are in the Axis Java tool:</p>
<br>
<p> &nbsp &nbsp axis.jar <br>
&nbsp &nbsp commons-discovery.jar <br>
&nbsp &nbsp commons-logging.jar <br>
&nbsp &nbsp jaxrpc.jar <br>
&nbsp &nbsp saaj.jar <br>
&nbsp &nbsp wsdl4j.jar <br>
&nbsp &nbsp xml-apis.jar <br> </p>
<p>"SchemaUtils.java" and "ElementDecl.java" files have been overridden and their original implementations are no longer used even though they exist in the above mentioned jars.</p>

<p>No classes have been extended at the present time.</p>

<p>Except for "SchemaUtils.java" and "ElementDecl.java" the rest of the code has been developed for the Axis C++ tool and is not present in the current Axis Java tool.</p>
