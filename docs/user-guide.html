<h2><a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to Axis C++, a c++ implementation of SOAP ! </p>
<h3>What is SOAP?</h3>
<p>SOAP is an XML<i>-</i>based communication protocol and encoding format for 
inter-application communication. Originally conceived by Microsoft and Userland 
software, it has evolved through several generations and the current spec,
<a HREF="http://w3.org/TR/soap">SOAP 1.1</a>, is fast growing in popularity and 
usage. The W3C's <a HREF="http://www.w3.org/2000/xp/Group/">XML Protocol working 
group</a> is in the process of turning SOAP into a true open standard, and as of 
this writing has released a working draft of SOAP 1.2, which cleans up some of 
the more confusing areas of the 1.1 spec. </p>
<p>SOAP is widely viewed as the backbone to a new generation of cross-platform 
cross-language distributed computing applications, termed Web Services. </p>
<h3>What is Axis c++?</h3>
<p>Axis is essentially a <i>SOAP engine</i>. The more complete version of axis 
is written in java.This version is written in c++ and will continue to be 
developed. </p>
<p>Axis c++ includes</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">an apache module that can be plugged in to the 
  apache webserver on linux,</li>
  <li>
  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A set of sample web service classes and their 
  handwritten wrapper classes.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope you enjoy using Axis c++. Please note that this is an open-source effort 
- if you feel the code could use some new features or fixes, please get involved 
and lend a hand! The Axis developer community welcomes your participation. </p>
<h4><b>Let us know what you think!</b></h4>
<p>Please send feedback about the package to &quot;<a HREF="mailto:axis-user@xml.apache.org">axis-user@xml.apache.org</a>&quot;. </p>
<h3>What's in Axis c++ at this moment?</h3>
<p>Axis c++ includes the following features: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Partial SOAP 1.1 compliant engine</li>
  <li>
  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Support for all basic types</li>
  <li>
  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Automatic serialization/deserialization of Java 
  Beans, including customizable mapping of fields to XML elements/attributes
  </li>
  <li>
  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Provider for RPC and based SOAP 
  services </li>
</ul>
<h2><a NAME="ConsumingServices"></a>Consuming Web Services with Axis C++</h2>
<h2><a NAME="PublishingServices"></a>Publishing Web Services with Axis C++</h2>
<p>This chapter explains how to deploy the sample web services included with 
Axis C++.</p>
<p>Hopefully by now you have installed Axis C++.<br>
<br>
If you haven't already done so download the binary version of Axis C++ and 
follow the instructions in the integration-guide to install it.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>From here onwards the folder in which Axis C++ is installed by being 
extracted from the Axis C++ installation package will be referred to as <br>
&lt;axiscpp_home&gt;.<br>
<br>
sample webservice modules are included in &lt;axiscpp_home&gt;/src/server/samples/<br>
<br>
in this folder you will find two subfolders called webservice and 
webservicewrapper and <br>
service.wsdd file written by the service provider for his service.</p>
<p>In &lt;axiscpp_home&gt;/src/server/samples/ there are two subfolders called 
webservice and webservicewrapper.</p>
<p>In the webservice folder, the header files and cpp files written in c++, for 
each of the webservice can be found. In the webservicewrapper folder the 
corresponding the wrapper classes for each of the webservices can be found. The 
wrapper classes are supposed to be generated by a tool which, is not implemented 
yet. When the wrapper generator is implemented you should be able to generate 
the files in webservicewrapper, using the header files for any given webservice 
provider class.</p>
<p>Now change directory to the webservice/&lt;sample name&gt; folder and type the 
following</p>
<p>make clean<br>
make<br>
<br>
Now go into the webservicewrapper&lt;sample name&gt; folder and type the following </p>
<p>make clean<br>
make<br>
<br>
You will find the corresponding web service module generated in &lt;axiscpp_home&gt;/axis/webservice 
folder.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restart apache web server and test the web service using the java webservice 
client. For infromation on how to use the java web service client refer to the 
Axis java user guide which can be found at http://ws.apache.org/axis/.<br>
<br>
If you want to test handlers go into the &lt;axiscpp_home&gt;/src/servcer/handlers 
folder where example handlers are included. Change to a particular example 
directory of your choice and type the following</p>
<p>make clean<br>
make</p>
<p>You will find the corresponding handler generated in &lt;axiscpp_home&gt;axis/handlers 
directory.<br>
Restart the apache web server and test your handler using the web service client 
in Axis java.For infromation on how to use the java web service client refer to 
the Axis java user guide which can be found at http://ws.apache.org/axis/.<br>
<br>
Happy Axiscpp!!!<br>

<h2><a NAME="published interfaces"></a>Published Axis Interfaces</h2>

<h2><a NAME="tcpmon"></a>Appendix : Using the Axis TCP Monitor (tcpmon)</h2>
<p>This section describe a java tool that is included with Axis java that can be 
used to view what goes on the wire when a soap transaction is taking place. 
Please visit <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/">http://ws.apache.org/axis/</a> 
and get Axis java, to obtain tcpmon.</p>
<p>The &quot;tcpmon&quot; utility can be found in the org.apache.axis.utils 
package. To run it from the command line: </p>
<pre STYLE="color: #000000; margin-left: 0.98cm; margin-bottom: 0.5cm">% java org.apache.axis.utils.tcpmon [listenPort targetHost targetPort]</pre>
<p>Without any of the optional arguments, you will get a gui which looks like 
this: </p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">
<img SRC="images/tcpmon1.jpg" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="599" HEIGHT="599" BORDER="0"></p>
<p>To use the program, you should select a local port which tcpmon will monitor 
for incoming connections, a target host where it will forward such connections, 
and the port number on the target machine which should be &quot;tunneled&quot; to. Then 
click &quot;add&quot;. You should then notice another tab appearing in the window for your 
new tunneled connection. Looking at that panel, you'll see something like this:
</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">
<img SRC="images/tcpmon2.jpg" NAME="Graphic3" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="599" HEIGHT="600" BORDER="0"></p>
<p>Now each time a SOAP connection is made to the local port, you will see the 
request appear in the &quot;Request&quot; panel, and the response from the server in the 
&quot;Response&quot; panel. Tcpmon keeps a log of all request/response pairs, and allows 
you to view any particular pair by selecting an entry in the top panel. You may 
also remove selected entries, or all of them, or choose to save to a file for 
later viewing. </p>
<p>The &quot;resend&quot; button will resend the request you are currently viewing, and 
record a new response. This is particularly handy in that you can edit the XML 
in the request window before resending - so you can use this as a great tool for 
testing the effects of different XML on SOAP servers. Note that you may need to 
change the content-length HTTP header value before resending an edited request.
