<h1>Installing the Xerces XML parser</h1>
<br> 
<p>Download the Xerces-C 2.2.0 ( 32 bit binary release) from:
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/download.cgi">http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/download.cgi</a> <br> <br>

Extract the Xerces-C 2.2.0 binary version. We will refer to this folder as [Xerces_Folder].</p>

<p><a name="apache"></a></p>  
<h1> Installation with Apache 1.3.X/2.X web server</h1>

<p>Steps: <br>
<br>

1. Install apache web server and locate the installation folder(For the default installation (apache 1.3.X) the path is "C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache"  and for apache 2.X the path is  "C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2" ). Lets say this folder is [Apache_Folder]. <br>
<br>

2. Unzip the binary distribution to a folder of your choice. Say this folder is Axis_Extract.<br>
<br>

3. Inside the extracted folder Axis_Extract there is a sub folder called deploy. Copy the whole deploy folder to [Apache_Folder].<br>
<br>

4. Rename copied "deploy" folder to "Axis". Lets say this folder is  [Axis_Folder].<br>
<br>

5. Set environment variable AXISCPP_DEPLOY to point to above folder.<br>
<br>

6. Add [Axis_Folder]/lib to the PATH environment variable.<br>
<br>

7. Add the following lines to the bottom of Apache configuration file httpd.conf located in [Apache_Folder]/conf <br> 
<br>
LoadModule axis_module modules/[Axis_Module]<br>
&lt;Location /axis&gt;<br>
SetHandler axis <br>
&lt;/Location&gt;<br> <br>

[Axis_Module] is either mod_axis.dll for apache 1.3.X or mod_axis2.dll for apache 2.X. <br>
<br>

8. Copy [Axis_Module]  from Axis_Extract/bin folder to [Apache_Folder]/modules folder.<br> <br>

9. Copy AxisServer.dll,HTTPTransport.dll and HTTPChannel.dll from Axis_Extract/bin folder  to [Axis_Folder]/lib <br>
<br>

10.Rename AxisXMLParser_Xerces.dll (which is located at Axis_Extract/bin ) to AxisXMLParser.dll and copy it to [Axis_Folder]/lib </p>
<br>
<p>
 <li>Copy xerces-c_2_2_0.dll from [Xerces_Folder]/bin/ to [Axis_Folder]/lib/ </li> 
 </p> <br> <br>
<p><b>Note:</b> This could also be done by editing the axiscpp.conf. <br>

11. Open the [Axis_Folder]/axiscpp.conf_win for editing. The contents of the file will look as follows.<br> <br>

LogPath:XXXX <br>
WSDDFilePath:YYYY <br>
XMLParser:ZZZZ <br>
Transport_http:AAAA <br>
Channel_HTTP:BBBB <br>
<br>
 XXXX is the path to a file named AxisLog (The log file)and YYYY is the path to the server.wsdd file. Give the appropriate values for XXXX and YYYY as follows.ZZZZ is the path to the XMLParser and AAAA is the path to the Transport used and BBBB is the path to the Channel used.<br> <br>

i.e. <br> <br>

LogPath: [Apache_Folder]\Axis\logs\AxisLog <br>
WSDDFilePath: [Apache_Folder]\Axis\conf\server.wsdd <br>
XMLParser:[Apache_Folder]\Axis\lib\AxisXMLParser.dll <br>
Transport_http:[Apache_Folder]\Axis\lib\HTTPTransport.dll<br>
Channel_HTTP:[Apache_Folder]\Axis\lib\HTTPChannel.dll<br> <br>


server.wsdd is located at [Apache_Folder]\Axis\conf\ for Apache 1.3 and Apache 2. (There will be three wsdd files in the [Apache_Folder]\Axis\conf\ rename the relevant wsdd file of your platform to server.wsdd).<br> <br>

Also in order to run the provided samples do the following.<br> <br>
Open server.wsdd for editing. For each service element, locate the element "parameter name", which has the value "classname". <br>
Give the absolute path of the indicated webservice.dll  in the "value" attribute <br>  <br>
Rename axiscpp.conf_win which is in [Axis_Folder] to axiscpp.conf <br> <br>

12. Restart the apache web server. If you have done correctly apache server will start without giving any error.</p> 
<br> 

<p><b>apache 1.3.X : </b> <br> <br>
It is recommended to start apache 1.3.X  as "apache -k start" on the command line <br> <br>

<b>apache 2.X :</b> <br> <br>
While testing the apache 2 module a problem was noted with the apache 2 web server, in that the webserver takes about 98% of CPU time and the server does not even serve the startup page. <br> <br> The workaround for this is to start the apache web server as "apache -X" to make it run single threaded. <br> <br> While this is sufficient to test the apache 2 module this problem needs to be investigated further.<br> <br>(However on a different machine, when I simply run the apache2 executable (version
2.0.49) without any
arguments, as, "apache" on windows 2000 professional, service pack 5,
with/without Axis C++ it seems to be working fine. <br> <br>
 
But in this machine  the apache could not be started as "apache -k start" (i.e. as a
service). It
simply exists and does not start. The 98% CPU usage scenario cannot be reproduced in
this machine. <br> <br>
It could happen with some other apache 2 versions or in different service packs.
) <br> <br>

13. Open an internet browser and check <a href="http://localhost/axis">http://localhost/axis</a> If the module has loaded properly then you will get the axis welcome page with a listing of deployed web services.<br> <br>

<h1>Installation with Simple Axis Server</h1>

<p>STEPS:</p>
<p>
1. Download binaries
Axis C++ binary from <a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/ws/axis-c/axis-c-win32-current-bin.zip">http://www.apache.org/dist/ws/axis-c/axis-c-win32-current-bin.zip</a> 
<br>
Xerces binary from <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/xml/xerces-c/Xerces-C_2_2_0/xerces-c2_2_0-win32.zip">http://archive.apache.org/dist/xml/xerces-c/Xerces-C_2_2_0/xerces-c2_2_0-win32.zip</a>
<br>
<br>

2. Extract downloads
<br>
Extract axis-c-win32-current-bin.zip to D:\axis-c-1-5-win32
<br>
Extract xerces-c2_2_0-win32.zip to D:\xerces-c2_2_0-win32
<br>
<br>

3. Copy Xerces lib to Axis C++ extract folder
<br>
<pre>
copy D:\xerces-c2_2_0-win32\bin\xerces-c_2_2_0.dll D:\axis-c-1-5-win32\bin
</pre>
<br>

4. Set Environment variables
<br>
Open a command shell and run:
<br>
<pre>
set AXISCPP_DEPLOY=D:\axis-c-1-5-win32
set PATH=%PATH%;%AXISCPP_DEPLOY%\bin
</pre>
<br>

5. Set up the configuration
<br>
On the same shell used in step 4 run:
<br>
<pre>
cd %AXISCPP_DEPLOY%
</pre>

Now you should be on D:\axis-c-1-5-win32
<br>

Copy the conf file:
<br>
<pre>
copy deploy\axiscpp.conf_win axiscpp.conf
</pre>
<br>

Edit the conf file to have the following content
<br>
<pre>
LogPath:D:\axis-c-1-5-win32\bin\AxisLog.txt
WSDDFilePath:D:\axis-c-1-5-win32\samples\server.wsdd
XMLParser:D:\axis-c-1-5-win32\bin\AxisXMLParserXerces.dll
Transport_http:D:\axis-c-1-5-win32\bin\HTTPTransport.dll
Channel_HTTP:D:\axis-c-1-5-win32\bin\HTTPChannel.dll
</pre>

<b>NOTE: Please do not set Channel_HTTP_SSL in axiscpp.conf</b>
<br>
<br>

Now setup the server.wsdd file
<br>
<pre>
copy samples\server.wsdd.win32 samples\server.wsdd
</pre>
Edit server.wsdd file to match your settings 
(In this case replace all C:\obj\samples with D:\axis-c-1-5-win32\deploy\webservices)
<br>
<br>

6. Run SimpleAxisServer
On the same command shell used in steps 4 and 5
<br>
<pre>
bin\simpleaxisserver 9090
</pre>
<br>

7. Run clients
Open a new command shell
<br>
Set environment variables:
<br>
<pre>
set AXISCPP_DEPLOY=D:\axis-c-1-5-win32
set PATH=%PATH%;%AXISCPP_DEPLOY%\bin
</pre>
<br>

cd to %AXISCPP_DEPLOY%
<br>

And run the sample
<br>
<pre>
bin\base http://localhost:9090/axis/base
</pre>
<br>

<h1>Running Provided Samples</h1>

You can find the samples in "bin" folder of the Axis C++ extract folder.
<br>
To get help on how to run sample run : <i>&lt;sample executable name&gt; [-?] -h] </i>
<br>
For more information on how to build samples using ant please see <a href="samples-guide.html">Axis C++ Samples Guide</a>
<br>

<p><a name="playsamples"></a></p>

<h1>Using Visual C++ to play with provided samples.</h1>

<p>In your Axis_Extract/samples folder you have the samples.<br> <br>
 If you are using Visual C++ you can open the workspace file for client applications which are in Axis_Extract\c\samples\client\interoptests\interoptests.dsw <br> <br>
 Deployable webservices are in Axis_Extract\c\samples\server\interoptests\interoptests.dsw and you can play with them. <br> <br>
There are seven projects in the workspace.
