<h1>Installing the Expat XML parser </h1>
<p>If you decide to use the Expat parser you need to install the Expat parser. Download the Expat-1.95.7 binary version from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/</a> <br> <br>
Extract the Expat binaries to a folder Called Expat ,we will refer to this folder as [EXPAT_EXTRACT].</p> <br> <br>

<p><a name="#parser2"> </a> </p>

<h1>Installing the Xerces XML parser</h1>
<br> 
<p>If you decide to use the Xerces parser you need to install the Xerces parser. Download the Xerces-C 2.2.0 ( 32 bit binary release) from:
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/download.cgi">http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/download.cgi</a> <br> <br>

Extract the Xerces-C 2.2.0 binary version. We will refer to this folder as [XERCES_EXTRACT].</p>

<p><a name=#apache"></a></p>  
<h1> Installation with Apache 1.3.X/2.X web server</h1>

<p>Steps: <br>
<br>

1. Install apache web server and locate the installation folder(For the default installation (apache 1.3.X) the path is "C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache"  and for apache 2.X the path is  "C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2" ). Lets say this folder is APACHE_FOLDER. <br>
<br>

2. Unzip the binary distribution to a folder of your choice. Say this folder is AXIS_EXTRACT.<br>
<br>

3. Inside the extracted folder AXIS_EXTRACT there is a sub folder called deploy. Copy the whole deploy folder to APACHE_FOLDER.<br>
<br>

4. Rename copied "deploy" folder to "Axis". Lets say this folder is  AXIS_FOLDER.<br>
<br>

5. Set environment variable AXISCPP_DEPLOY to point to above folder.<br>
<br>

6. Add AXIS_FOLDER/lib to the PATH environment variable.<br>
<br>

7. Add the following lines to the bottom of Apache configuration file httpd.conf located in APACHE_FOLDER/conf <br> 
<br>
LoadModule axis_module modules/AXISMODULE<br>
&lt;Location/axis&gt;<br>
SetHandler axis <br>
&lt;/Location&gt;<br> <br>

AXISMODULE is either mod_axis.dll for apache 1.3.X or mod_axis2.dll for apache 2.X. <br>
<br>

8. Copy AXISMODULE from AXIS_EXTRACT/bin folder to APACHE_FOLDER/modules folder.<br> <br>

9. Copy AxisServer.dll and AxisTransport.dll from AXIS_EXTRACT/bin folder  to AXIS_FOLDER/lib <br>
<br>

10.If you want to use the Expat parser with Axis C++, rename AxisXMLParser_Expat.dll (which is located at AXIS_EXTRACT/bin) to AxisXMLParser.dll and copy it to AXIS_FOLDER/lib <br>
<br> 

11.If you want to use the Xerces parser with Axis C++, rename AxisXMLParser_Xerces.dll (which is located at AXIS_EXTRACT/bin) to AxisXMLParser.dll and copy it to AXIS_FOLDER/lib </p>
<br>
<p><li>Copy libexpat.dll file from [EXPAT_EXTRACT]\Libs to [AXISCPP_DEPLOY]/lib/ </li> 
 <li>Copy xerces-c_2_2_0.dll from [XERCES_EXTRACT]/bin/ to [AXISCPP_DEPLOY]/lib/ </li> 
 </p> <br> <br>
<p><b>Note:</b> This could also be done by editing the axiscpp.conf. <br>

12. Open the AXISCPP_DEPLOY/axiscpp.conf_win for editing. The contents of the file will look as follows.<br> <br>

LogPath:XXXX <br>
WSDDFilePath:YYYY <br>
XMLParser:ZZZZ <br>
Transport_http:AAAA <br>
<br>
 XXXX is the path to a file named AxisLog (The log file)and YYYY is the path to the server.wsdd file. Give the appropriate values for XXXX and YYYY as follows.ZZZZ is the path to the XMLParser and AAAA is the path to the Transport used.<br> <br>

i.e. <br> <br>

LogPath: [APACHE_HOME]\Axis\logs\AxisLog <br>
WSDDFilePath: [APACHE_HOME]\Axis\conf\server.wsdd <br>
XMLParser:[APACHE_HOME]\Axis\lib\AxisXMLParser.dll
Transport_http:[APACHE_HOME]\Axis\lib\AxisTransport.dll<br>

server.wsdd is located at [APACHE_HOME]\Axis\conf\ for Apache 1.3 and Apache 2. (There will be three wsdd files in the [APACHE_HOME]\Axis\conf\ rename the relevant wsdd file of your platform to server.wsdd).<br> <br>

Also in order to run the provided samples do the following.<br> <br>
Open server.wsdd for editing. For each service element, locate the element "parameter name", which has the value "classname". <br>
Give the absolute path of the indicated webservice.dll  in the "value" attribute <br>  <br>
Rename axiscpp.conf_win which is in AXISCPP_DEPLOY to axiscpp.conf <br> <br>

13. Restart the apache web server. If you have done correctly apache server will start without giving any error.</p> 
<br> 

<p><b>apache 1.3.X : </b> <br> <br>
It is recommended to start apache 1.3.X  as "apache -k start" on the command line <br> <br>

<b>apache 2.X :</b> <br> <br>
While testing the apache 2 module a problem was noted with the apache 2 web server, in that the webserver takes about 98% of CPU time and the server does not even serve the startup page. <br> <br> The workaround for this is to start the apache web server as "apache -X" to make it run single threaded. <br> <br> While this is sufficient to test the apache 2 module this problem needs to be investigated further.<br> <br>(However on a different machine, when I simply run the apache2 executable (version
2.0.49) without any
arguments, as, "apache" on windows 2000 professional, service pack 5,
with/without Axis C++ it seems to be working fine. <br> <br>
 
But in this machine  the apache could not be started as "apache -k start" (i.e. as a
service). It
simply exists and does not start. The 98% CPU usage scenario cannot be reproduced in
this machine. <br> <br>
It could happen with some other apache 2 versions or in different service packs.
) <br> <br>

14. Open an internet browser and check <a href="http://localhost/axis">http://localhost/axis</a> If the module has loaded properly then you will get the axis welcome page with a listing of deployed web services.<br> <br>

<h1>Installation with Simple Axis Server</h1>

<p>STEPS:</p>
<p>
1. Create a folder of your choice. We will call this folder as SIMPLE_AXIS_SERVER_FOLDER.<br> <br>
2. Unzip the binary distribution to a folder of your choice. Say this folder is AXIS_EXTRACT.<br> <br>
3. Inside the extracted folder AXIS_EXTRACT there is a sub folder called deploy. Copy the whole deploy folder to  SIMPLE_AXIS_SERVER_FOLDER.<br> <br>
4. Rename copied "deploy" folder to "Axis". Lets say this folder is AXIS_FOLDER.<br> <br>
5. Set environment variable AXISCPP_DEPLOY to point to above AXIS_FOLDER.<br> <br>
6. Add AXIS_FOLDER/lib to the PATH environment variable.<br> <br>
7. Copy the SimpleAxisServer.exe from AXIS_EXTRACT/bin to the SIMPLE_AXIS_SERVER_FOLDER.<br> <br>
8. Copy AxisServer.dll and AxisTransport.dll from AXIS_EXTRACT/bin folder to AXIS_FOLDER/lib <br> <br>
9.If you want to use the Expat parser with Axis C++, rename AxisXMLParser_Expat.dll (which is located at  AXIS_EXTRACT/bin) to AxisXMLParser.dll and copy it to AXIS_FOLDER/lib <br> <br>
10.If you want to use the Xerces parser with Axis C++, rename AxisXMLParser_Xerces.dll (which is located at  AXIS_EXTRACT/bin) to AxisXMLParser.dll and copy it to AXIS_FOLDER/lib <br> <br>
11. Start the SimpleAxisServer by providing the port to which it operates.(eg: c:\SimpleAxisServer>SimpleAxisServer 80)

<h1>Running Provided Samples</h1>

<p>If Axis installation is a complete success, then the following sample web services and handlers have been installed successfully. Please click on the following link to see the deployed web services. <a href="http://localhost/axis">http://localhost/axis</a> <br> <br>

You will find the built console applications at AXIS/c/bin directory. Following are the built .exe files. <br> <br>
1.base.exe <br>
2.cbase.exe <br>
3.doclitbase.exe <br>
4.doclitgroupB.exe <br>
5.groupB.exe <br>
6.cgroupB.exe <br>

<br>
In order to run these samples you should have AxisClient.dll in the PATH environment variable or in the same directory where the client .exe is located.<br> <br>

You can run the provided client programs to confirm whether the Axis cpp server and clients are working fine. <br> <br>
To run these sample client applications you need to have the path to libexpat.dll in the "PATH" environment variable or libexpat.dll should be placed where the apache.exe is.(libexpat.dll can be found in [EXPAT_EXTRACT\libs)<br> <br>
<b> Note: These sample clients are compiled with the assumption that server is running at localhost port 80.</b><br>

<h1>Using Visual C++ to play with provided samples.</h1>

<p>In your AXIS_EXTRACT/samples folder you have the samples.<br> <br>
 If you are using Visual C++ you can open the workspace file for client applications which are in AXIS_EXTRACT\c\samples\client\interoptests\interoptests.dsw <br> <br>
 Deployable webservices are in AXIS_EXTRACT\c\samples\server\interoptests\interoptests.dsw and you can play with them. <br> <br>
There are seven projects in the workspace.
