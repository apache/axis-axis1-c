Linux Solaris :Apache web server

Download the axiscpp.tar.gz
gunzip and untar it where ever you like.
for simplicity assume that your axiscpp is now
/usr/local/axiscpp
From now on I call this <axiscpp_home>
goto <axiscpp_home>/release

copy the libaxiscpp_mod.so file into <apache home directory>/libexec directory.
For the apache server to load this shared module it (the apache web server) must be compiled 
with shareable module support (To do this, when running the configure script pass it the 
option "--enable-module=so") For further information on comipiling and installing the apache 
web server please visit http://httpd.apache.org .

open the httpd.conf file in <apache directory>/conf/
add the following lines

LoadFile /usr/local/apache/libexec/libaxiscpp_mod.so
LoadModule axis_module     libexec/libaxiscpp_mod.so

<Location /axis>
SetHandler axis
</Location>

where /axis is context path where the apache|axiscpp is listening to webservice requests.

Now stop the apache web server if it is already started.
Start the apache web server. If it starts without giving problem the module is successfully 
loaded.
Read the userguide for information on how to test the webservices on your newly installed 
soap server.
