To run the test samples

We hope that you have already installed axiscpp soap processor.

If you haven't already done so download the binary version of the axiscpp soap processor and
follow the instructions at integration-guide to install it.

From now on I refer to the axiscpp installation folder which you unfolded from the downloaded
tar file as <axiscpp_home>

sample webservice modules are available at <axiscpp_home>/src/server/samples/

in this folder you will find two subfolders called webservice and webservicewrapper and 
service.wsdd file written by the service provider for his service.

inside the webservice folder corresponding to the example service you are interested, you find the actual web service header and cpp files written in c++ by the service provider.

inside the webservicewrapper folder corresponding to example service folder you will find the files generated by the wrapper generator tool. Presently the wrapper generator is not implemented. So the wrapper generated files are provided inside
the webservicewrapper/<example name> folder for your convenience. When the wrapper generator is available you sould be
able to empty the files in webservicewrapper/<example name> folder and refill it by running the wrapper generator against the files in webservice/<example name> folder.


Now go into the  folder and type
make clean
make

You will find the corresponding service module generated in <axiscpp_home>/axis/webservice folder.
Restart apache and test your service.

If you want to test handlers go into the <axiscpp_home>/src/servcer/handlers folder where the examples of the
handlers are available. go into the perticular example you are interested and type
make clean
make
You will find the corresponding handler generated in <axiscpp_home>axis/handlers directory.
Restart the apache and test your handler.
 
Happy Axiscpp!!!
