When you download the source you have only Makfile.am's and configure.ac and
autogen.sh script for building.
to build go to axisroot dirctory.
sh autogen.sh

If you want to avoid cluttering of the source with object files use the build directory
to generate your object files. To do that do it as follows.
Copy the axisconfigure file from c directory to c/build directory.
Next just change the following line of it
./configure --libdir=/home/damitha/projects/axiscpp/c/release
into
../configure --libdir=/home/damitha/projects/axiscpp/c/release

Now from c/build directory run
sh axisconfigure

Note: Make sure you set the environment variables
APACHE_HOME and XERCES_HOME to appropriate values
for examele
APACHE_HOME="/usr/local/apache"
XERCES_HOME="/usr/local/xerces_c"
